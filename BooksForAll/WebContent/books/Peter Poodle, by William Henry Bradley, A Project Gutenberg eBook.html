stood with his little nose pressed
flat against the pane. He was very tired, and
also very hungry, for he had walked ever
and ever so far. How far, he did not know.
At first, he had thought it would take only
a day to reach the city, and now, he could
not remember how long it had taken. A good many days,
of that he was certain.</p>

<p>Over hills and through fields and forests he had travelled,
sleeping at night in the lee of some rick of hay, or on
the soft moss beneath low hung fir boughs. Sometimes, a
shepherd or a forester had shared with him his simple
fare of bread and cheese. At other times, he ate berries,
or such of the wild fruits as were then
ripe, and once, or <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
twice, he had gone to sleep hungry. But here he was, at
last, in the big city and before the most wonderful window
into which a boy ever looked. It was evening, and
the window, with its bright lights, seemed like a bit of
fairyland, for in it were all manner of the finest games
and toys imaginable.</p>

<p>Tommy did not know that this was Mr. Peter Poodle’s
famous toy shop. He did not even know the toys were
for sale. He had never been in a big city and knew nothing
about stores. He thought this was merely somebody’s
fine house, and when he lifted his eyes from the toys and
saw a big card that hung beneath one of the lamps, he
was more than ever filled with wonder.</p>

<div>“BOY WANTED!”</div>

<p>Those were the words on the card. Tommy spelled the
letters twice to make sure; “I suppose the people inside
must be lonely,” he thought “I will go in and visit them,
and perhaps they will tell me how to find the King.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle, a kindly little man with gray hair and bright
twinkling eyes, answered the rap at the door.</p>

<p>“Please sir,” said Tommy, “do you live here and are you
lonely? Because, if you are, I can come in and play with
you; but by and by, I must go and find the King. Please,
can you tell me where the King lives? Because the kind
lady, who took care of me when I was sick, is very poor.
Did you know that once I was very sick? When I was sick
the kind lady told me all about the Fairy King. I am well
now, and I am going to find the Fairy King and get some
gold and jewels for the kind lady. Would you like me to
come in and play with you a little while? I am too tired
to play very much, because I have been
walking all day. <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
And tonight, when I came through a dark street, a bad,
rough man chased me, and I ran so fast that it made me
more tired. Don’t you think I am a fast runner to get away
from the man? Please, shall we play games now? Perhaps
you don’t want to play with a little boy that has such raggedy
clothes. Would you rather have a little boy that has
fine clothes and wears shoes and stockings? I am sorry
you are lonesome. I think you are a nice man and I like
you; but perhaps you don’t want such a raggedy boy.”</p>

<p>The twinkling laughter had left the little man’s eyes and
the corners of his mouth twitched when he tried to speak.
Then he quickly stooped and held out both arms. “I do
want a raggedy boy” were the words that came from his
trembling lips, and the next second, Tommy’s curly head
was nestling on the little man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“What game shall we play now?” asked Mr. Poodle.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tommy. “Sometimes, when I was
sick and the kind lady gave me bread and milk, she said
we were playing dinner party. That is the only game I
know how to play. Please, sir, shall we play dinner party?”</p>

<p>The twinkle came back again into Mr. Poodle’s eyes.
“Yes, my boy, we <i>will</i> play dinner party,” he said. “I
think dinner party is a fine game.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle now spread the cloth on the table. “O me,
O my,” said he; “this cloth has a hole right in the corner!
O, well, that is soon mended.” Then, what did he do but
tear right off the whole corner. “There!” said he; “now
we have a cloth without any hole.”</p>

<p>“Here is a pitcher of milk,” he added, as he sat it on the
table; “and, here are two mugs. O dear, O dear, why this
mug has no handle! Now how could
that handle ever <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
have jumped right off the mug and we not see it! The
first thing tomorrow, I must get a new handle.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said Tommy, “the handle is gone from the
pitcher, too.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t mean to tell me that that handle also is
gone?” said Mr. Poodle, taking the pitcher. “Yes, it certainly
has. Now, how could that have happened? Oh, I
know. Those two handles were lonely the same as I was
lonely, and the mug handle said to the pitcher handle:
Mr. Pitcher handle, you can stay in this house if you wish,
but as for me, why was I trimmed all up with colored
paint and made so handsome, if it wasn’t for some little
boy; and now, there is no boy in this house, so I am just
going to leave! Of course, then the pitcher handle thought
he would be very lonely without the mug handle, and so
they went away together.”</p>

<p>Tommy laughed merrily. “You are a very funny man,”
he said. “Handles couldn’t say all that, but it was just a fine
story. Please tell it to me again.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I tell all that again,” said Mr. Poodle, “why then
our roast turkey will be getting cold.”</p>

<p>Tommy laughed gaily. “You certainly are a very funny
man,” he said. “This isn’t roast turkey, this is bread!”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Mr. Poodle. “Well, so it is. Now,
how could I ever have made such a silly mistake.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, sir,” said the boy. “I am sure the bread
is very nice, and I just love milk. Can we play now?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” answered Mr. Poodle.</p>

<p>When Tommy had eaten the bread and milk, Mr. Poodle
took him in his arms to the big easy chair. “What shall we
play now?” asked the toymaker.
<span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span></p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i007.jpg" width="600" height="514" alt="Helen."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>Tommy’s eyes were almost closed. “I don’t know,” he
answered. “Please, sir, I am very sorry, because I wanted
to play and make you happy, you are so kind to me, but I
am pretty tired. If I could go to sleep for only a minute,
then when I awake I would be all rested and could play
some more. Please, may I go to sleep for only a minute?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed you may,” said the toymaker.</p>

<p>Tommy’s tired eyes looked timidly up into Mr. Poodle’s.
“Please sir, may I kiss you for being so good to me?” he
asked. <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span></p>

<p>Mr. Poodle bowed his head. “Good night, boy,” he said.
“Good night, sir,” answered Tommy.</p>

<p>This was the manner in which Tommy Piper came to
Peter Poodle’s toy shop. Who he was and from where he
came, Mr. Poodle could not learn; only this much—that
he had been found unconscious in the forest by a poor
wood chopper, and tenderly nursed during a long illness
by the wood chopper’s good wife.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Poodle, he was the kindest and jolliest little
man you ever did see. His business was the making of
toys for little girls and boys, and he had a fine big shop all
littered with yellow, curly shavings, blocks of wood and
bits of colored cloth. In this shop, the first thing the next
morning, Tommy went to play.</p>

<p>He had on a nice new suit of clothes which Mr. Poodle
had provided, and he was glad indeed to be dressed so
finely, for right in the midst of the floor, sat a little girl.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Helen,” said Mr. Poodle.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Poodle,” Helen answered, and then
turning to Tommy, she said: “Good morning, little boy.”</p>

Toy Language. And of strange happenings in the
Brick House at the Sign of the Black Lion.</p>

lived in a fine big house around the corner on the next street, but
each day she came to play in the curly shavings with Tommy, and
together they watched Mr. Poodle make his toys.</p>

<p>Certainly those were fine toys Mr. Poodle
made. Helen’s mamma said there never was such a fine
toy maker anywhere as Mr. Poodle. She said that he loved
to sit at his bench and make the toy people, and that he
put every bit of his heart into his work; and of course,
when he loved his work so much, why some of his heart
and some of his love had to pop right out and jump
into the toys. Helen’s mamma said that
was why Peter <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
Poodle’s toys were the best in all the world, and moreover,
they were not painted with cheap colors that would
come off the minute you put them in your mouth, or
stuck together with bad smelling glue that would never
hold more than a day or two.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Mr. Poodle was making a toy he
would be singing such a funny song that Tommy and
Helen had to stop their play and have a good laugh. Then
Mr. Poodle would look at them over the tops of his spectacles,
and make believe he felt very cross because they
laughed. But Tommy and Helen could see the twinkle
that went jumping around in Mr. Poodle’s eyes, so they
knew he wasn’t one bit cross; he wasn’t either, for he
thought it fine to hear little boys and girls laugh. Why,
sometimes he would be so glad that he would take his
brush and paint a smile right on the face of one of the
toys he was making, and the smile would always stay
there, so the toy could be very happy as long as it lived.
That was the kind of a man Mr. Poodle was.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Poodle’s toys were not the common
everyday sort. No, indeed! why some of them looked as
if they could truly walk and talk like real people. Mr.
Poodle said that really and truly toys could walk and talk.</p>

<p>Tommy and Helen laughed when Mr Poodle spoke
that way, and Tommy said: “Why, Mr. Poodle, toys can’t
talk, they haven’t any tongues.” Then you should have
heard Mr. Poodle laugh. “Prut,” he said, “didn’t you know
toys don’t have to have tongues to talk? Now you listen
and I will ask Master Rolie Polie to sing for you.” Master
Rolie Polie was the name of a little clown. Mr. Poodle had
a name for every one of his toys; he said
boys and girls <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
wouldn’t like to go through the world without names, and
neither did toys; and moreover, having names made them
much more sociable. Then Mr. Poodle introduced the
clown to Helen and Tommy: “Master Rolie Polie,” he
said, “this lady and gentleman would like to have you sing
them a song. Let it be something funny, something jolly.”</p>

<p>Tommy and Helen now listened very quietly, and Mr.
Poodle tilted back his chair and beat time with his finger
while he hummed the words of a little song, just as if he
were repeating them after the clown. When he finished,
he nodded his head approvingly and said: “Very good!
Very good, indeed! Thank you, Master Rolie Polie; that
was a fine song and no mistake.”</p>

<p>Helen and Tommy laughed at the funny song, and
thanked Mr. Poodle. “We liked the song very much,” said
Tommy. “But I think, Mr. Poodle, we never would have
heard one single word if you had not been singing also.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle then patted both of them on the head very
kindly and said: “Never mind, it certainly is a little hard
in the beginning to hear what the toy people say, because
not having any tongues they cannot talk plainly. But by
and by, if you only try to learn and are patient, you will
get to know the toy language, and then you can understand
every bit as well as I do.”</p>

<p>Helen and Tommy thought that would be fine, and said
they were sure they could be patient.</p>

<p>After that, Mr. Poodle had two little soldiers, Captain
Hinkle Pinkle of the infantry and Captain Noddle Poddle
of the cavalry, lead their armies in a wonderful battle.</p>

<p>During the excitement of this battle no one noticed the
entrance of a stranger. Had Tommy
looked, he would <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
have seen the man to be that same big ruffian who had
chased him through the dark street the night he came to
the toy shop. A sly look appeared in the man’s eyes as he
caught sight of Tommy, and a wicked smile twisted the
corners of his mouth. Then he turned to the door, and,
lifting the latch, quickly left the toy shop.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i014.jpg" width="600" height="506" alt="After the Battle."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>Helen was glad when the war ended for it frightened
her and besides she did not like battles, so she thought she
would go home to her mamma. But Tommy said: “Don’t
you be afraid Helen, I was holding your hand and I
would not let any of the
soldiers hurt you.” <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span></p>

<p>“Did the soldiers really and truly fight, Tommy?” Helen
asked, when they were again seated in the pile of yellow,
curly shavings. “Didn’t Mr. Poodle move them about with
his hand, and wasn’t it he who blew upon the trumpet?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, the soldiers certainly were fighting,” said
Tommy. “When Mr. Poodle moved them, he did only
what the captains ordered. Didn’t you hear Captain Pinkle
and Captain Poddle shouting their commands, Helen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think, I did,” said Helen. “Which captain do you
think was the best fighter, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“I believe captain Poddle was the best fighter,” said
Tommy. “Don’t you think Captain Poddle was the best,
Helen?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Helen. “I think Captain Pinkle was
a very brave fighter, too, and I wished he had a horse to
ride, like Captain Poddle’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy, “Captain Pinkle was a brave fighter.
I think they were both brave fighters; don’t you think they
were both brave fighters, Helen?”</p>

<p>When Mr. Poodle heard these words of the children,
he said: “Well, well, well, you certainly are getting clever
at learning the toy language. I think you must know it
now nearly as well as I do. That is because you love the
toy people and they love you. What do you say to our
taking a trip tomorrow to Toyville?”</p>

<p>“Toyville?” asked Helen and Tommy. “Please, Mr.
Poodle, where is Toyville?”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle laughed when he heard that question. “O,
dear,” he said, “the idea of any little boys or girls not
knowing about Toyville! that really is most absurd. Why,
Toyville is the finest and jolliest little city
to be found <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
anywhere in the whole world. I thought everybody
knew about Toyville.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you please tell us some more?” asked Helen
and Tommy. “Is it very far away, Mr. Poodle? Can we
really and truly go there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Poodle, “we can really and truly go
there. Toyville is only a little way beyond the Hills of
Troubleland; it lies in the Vale of Joy, which, by some
people is called the Valley of Happiness. Once upon a
time, so long ago, indeed, that nobody living now can
remember exactly how long, there wasn’t any Toyville.
Then, one day, some of the Toy people made the perilous
trip through the Hills of Troubleland, and upon coming
into the Vale of Joy, found the land so beautiful that they
at once set about the building of a little city. By and by,
other Toy people came that way, and the city grew and
grew until it covered all the valley.”</p>

<p>“Will Captain Pinkle, Captain Poddle and Rolie Polie go
there to live some time?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“And will my dolly go there, too, Mr. Poodle?” asked
Helen.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Poodle, “all the Toy people go there
sometime unless they get lost by the way, somewhere
in the Hills of Troubleland. You see, first of all, the Toy
people came into this world to live with little boys and
girls to play with them and make them happy. Some of
the Toy people go to one city, some to another, and some
even go to live in the country. The Toy people never care
to what house they go if there is only a boy or girl living
there, but houses that are without children are much too
lonesome. <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes boys and girls get tired of playing with the
Toy people, or they grow up and get so big feeling they
think the games the Toy people play are silly. And sometimes
boys and girls are rough with the Toy people,
tossing them about until their joints get loose or even
broken, and their heads battered. Then, the Toy people,
knowing there is no longer a welcome for them, in those
houses, feel sad and go off to hide in a drawer somewhere,
and by and by, even get up in the attic hidden away
behind boxes or trunks. They wait patiently for perhaps
almost a year, hoping every day to hear the children call
for them; but the children have forgotten all about their
old playmates. Then, one day, when it is raining and
nobody can go out of doors, somebody thinks about the
Toy people and goes to search, first, in the drawer, then
in the attic. Alas, it is too late! the Toy people have gone,
gone for ever. Gone through the Hills of Troubleland
into the Valley of Happiness, where they are now living
peacefully in their beautiful city of Toyville.”</p>

<p>“Do the Toy people play and have fun in Toyville, Mr.
Poodle?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Fun!” How Mr. Poodle did laugh when he repeated
that word. “Yes, indeed, they have fun,” he said. “Of
course, the older people have work to do; like flower
gardens to plant; and orchards and such things to tend;
but the little Toy people have more fun than I can ever
find words to tell about. Why, everybody can sing and
laugh and have ever and ever so much sport. Nobody in
Toyville cares one single mite how much noise is made.
They all think it the finest kind of fun to see the little Toy
people have a good time. If the little Toy
people want to, <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
they can get down on their knees and play, and never
wear out their stockings. If the little Toy people want to
dig in the dirt and make mud pies, or build forts, or play
grocery store, their clothes or their hands and faces never
get at all soiled, because the dirt there is not one bit dirty.
Yes indeed, Toyville is certainly a fine place in which to
have fun.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle now looked at the clock. “O me, O my,” said
he; “it is almost supper time, and here I am talking away
as if we never had to bother about eating. Run along now,
but come back early to-morrow and I will have everything
ready for our journey to Toyville.”</p>

<p>That night when Helen’s mamma was tucking her up
cosily in bed so she would have happy dreams, Helen
said: “Mamma, to-morrow Mr. Poodle is going to take
Tommy and me for a visit to Toyville.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>“That will be lovely,” said Helen’s mamma. “Toyville
is a very fine place, indeed.” Then she kissed Helen good-night,
and soon the little girl was fast asleep.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i021b.jpg" width="405" height="459" alt="H"></span>ELEN was at the toymaker’s bright and
early the next morning. She brought a little
basket in which were some nice chicken
sandwiches and two rosy red apples for
herself and Tommy.</p>

<p>Helen told Tommy her mamma thought
that on a trip to Toyville they would need some lunch.
“And,” she continued, “Mamma said we might remain in
Toyville all day if we wished, and Mr. Poodle is willing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle’s eyes went twinkling again when he heard
Helen talking to Tommy. Then he told Helen her mamma
was very thoughtful and kind to prepare such
a fine lunch, <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
and he said there was no telling what might happen on
a trip of this kind, though he expected to find plenty of
good things to eat in Toyville. “Everything is now ready,”
said he. “I have sent a Messenger ahead to tell the Toy
people we are coming, and I expect they will greet us
with a royal welcome. The Mayor and his councillors, or,
at least, a company of the Toyville Guards will probably
meet us at the gates on the other side of the Hills of
Troubleland.”</p>

<p>While Tommy was busily engaged packing the lunch
into a little express wagon, Mr. Poodle left the work room
to wait upon two customers who had just entered the
shop. He did not at all like their looks and began to wonder
what might be their errand, as they were certainly
ruffians and could hardly have come to buy toys.</p>

<p>His first thought was a desire to be rid of them, and
with this in mind, he made some apology about it being
early and the shop not yet open for business.</p>

<p>At first, the men seemed somewhat ill at ease, but
before Mr. Poodle could finish speaking, the smaller and
coarser of the pair turned upon him roughly. “We will
stay right here until we are through with you,” he said;
“and don’t give us any more of your fine talk either. Do
you hear?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile his companion had glanced into the back
room and saw Tommy. “Leave this to me,” he whispered.
“The boy is here and I have thought of a plan.” Then
he turned to the toymaker. “You are right, sir,” he said,
in a voice smooth and oily. “The day certainly is young.
We beg your pardon for having disturbed you so early.
You see, we are about to leave the city
and would like <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
a few toys to take to the children at home; say this, and
this, and that,” and throwing, as he spoke, a gold piece
upon the counter. “Never mind the change. Perhaps you
have a boy who will deliver these. Pray send him soon,
as we depart in an hour. Send to the Inn at the sign of the
Black Lion.” Then, without waiting for a reply, they
opened the door and were gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle looked at the gold piece: “A big price to pay
for a few toys,” he thought. Then he looked at the toys.
Captain Hinkle Pinkle, Captain Noddle Poddle and Rolie
Polie were the ones the man bought. Mr. Poodle did not
like to sell these, they were such friends of Tommy and
Helen. But now it was too late, he had the money and
there was nothing he could do except to put them in a
box for Tommy to take to the Black Lion Inn.</p>

<p>Tommy was glad to help Mr. Poodle by going the errand
and said he would hurry, so as not to delay the journey
to Toyville. Then taking the box of toys he trudged off
up the street and soon came in sight of the big Black Lion
sign hanging over the door of an old brick and timbered
house.</p>

<p>“Why this is the street where the man chased me,” he
thought, “and this is the house where I first saw him. I
will be glad when I get back again to Mr. Poodle’s toy
shop.” Just then a company of soldiers came galloping
around a corner further down the street. Tommy turned
to lift the latch, but before he could do this, the door
swung open and a hand grabbed him roughly and pulled
him over the threshold, while the door was quickly closed
and barred. The big room in which he now found himself,
was lit only by one sputtering candle
which winked and <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
blinked upon the wall like the eye of some evil monster.
By this dim light he could make out four rough men.</p>

<p>Tommy was now thoroughly frightened. His heart
was beating very loud. He did not like to seem to be a
coward, but he felt sure those rough men meant to harm
him. “I will drop the basket and run,” he thought. Then
he remembered about the door being locked.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i024.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="Tommy."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed one of the men. “So my little
bird would spread his wings and fly, would he? Well, we
must clip those wings then.” As he spoke, he clutched
Tommy roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>Now whether the man pulled Tommy off his feet, or
whether the little fellow’s trembling
knees would no <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
longer support him, I do not know. But in a moment he
was lying on the floor with his head against the edge of
the toy box.</p>

<p>His head felt very numb, and he was very sleepy, and
he wondered why the men were binding him with such
a heavy cord. Then he wondered why there were so
many horses galloping out in the street, and why there
was such loud beating on the door. He thought he heard
someone call to him, but by some other name he had heard
long ago. At last he went to sleep.</p>

<div>CRASH!</div>

<p>What was that? Tommy opened wide his eyes. There
were confused voices in his ear; then he heard a whisper.
“Be quiet, be brave; we will help you. I am Rolie Polie.
Captain Hinkle Pinkle and Captain Noddle Poddle are
with me. We will rescue you.”</p>

<p>“Can you fight? Can you save me? Why how can you
save me?” asked Tommy. “You are only toys?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Rolie Polie. “Don’t speak, or they will hear
you. Get on your feet and follow us.”</p>

<p>Tommy wasn’t long in obeying. Hinkle Pinkle and
Noddle Poddle had swords drawn and led the way. Out
through the back rooms they went, into the kitchen then
on into the back yard. From the yard to a side street and
off to the toy shop, they hurried with all possible speed.</p>

<p>“Is everything ready for the journey?” Tommy called,
the minute he saw Mr. Poodle.</p>

<p>“Yes, everything is ready,” answered the toymaker.</p>

<p>“Then we must hurry,” said Tommy. “The ruffians are
after us.” <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Poodle, “give the order and we will
start.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Tommy assisted Helen to mount to the back of her
beautiful horse, called Snow White. And, after mounting
Coal Black, his own fine charger, he gave the order:</p>

quick response to Tommy’s command, the
whole company started. First, of all, walked
Mr. Poodle; next, came Tommy and Helen
riding their beautiful horses; then, Captain
Noddle Poddle, who rode at the head of his
company of cavalry; and after him, came
Captain Hinkle Pinkle leading his brave command of
infantry. Next, in line, was the express wagon; and last
of all rode Rolie Polie, sitting astride a funny little donkey.</p>

<p>At first, Mr. Poodle hesitated about having the little clown
accompanying them; he thought Rolie Polie was such a tricky fellow he
would be sure to get into no end of mischief. But he finally yielded
to the wishes of Helen and Tommy, much to their delight. <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span></p>

<p>Presently, Mr. Poodle spoke earnestly with Captain
Pinkle and Captain Poddle, cautioning them to keep their
soldiers near at hand and be ready in case of any attack
from pirates, or bandits, or ruffians.</p>

<p>Tommy jumped when Mr. Poodle said that. “Why,
Mr. Poodle,” he asked, “are there pirates and bandits in
Toyville?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Poodle, “I don’t think we will find any
in Toyville, but there may be some lurking in the hills by
the way. The crusty King of Grumbletown does not like
the people of Toyville very well; he is always threatening
to make war on them and keeps his ruffians and bandits
spying around to see what is happening in Toyville. I
suppose when he hears that visitors are on the road, he
will be more angry than ever, for he will not want a boy
and girl to go to Toyville and teach the Toy people new
tricks.”</p>

<p>“Is Grumbletown near Toyville, Mr. Poodle?” inquired
Tommy.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Mr. Poodle, “Toyville is at the lower end
of the valley, and Grumbletown is at the other end, but
the valley bends about a big hill which lies between the
two realms.”</p>

<p>“I do not think Grumbletown is a pretty name,” said
Helen. “Why is it called Grumbletown, Mr. Poodle?”</p>

<p>“Well dear,” said Mr. Poodle, “the name came about in
this way: one time it fell to the luck of some toys to go
and live with boys and girls who were always complaining
or fault finding, and who never were contented and
happy. Of course, when this happened, the toys were
sure to learn all manner of disagreeable
ways, and became <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
ill behaved and grumbly. Then, by and by, they ran away
to the Hills of Troubleland, and in place of going on to the
happy and prosperous city of Toyville, went further up
the valley and founded a new realm, which, because of
all its subjects being grumble toys was given the name of
Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>“Are there many people living in Grumbletown, Mr.
Poodle?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, there are,” said Mr. Poodle, “I am sorry to say it
is quite a large realm and is constantly growing larger,
because the toys of children who complain and find fault
always go to Grumbletown in place of Toyville. The King
of Grumbletown is a sly and crafty old pirate, called Red
Beard, and sometime, if he becomes too powerful, he will
make war on the peaceful, contented Toy people.”</p>

<p>It was a long, long way the happy little company now
travelled; through winding valleys they went and over
towering hills until at last, after crossing one high hill,
there spread before them, all at once, the broad walls and
beautiful gate at the entrance to the Valley of Happiness.
On the gate there was painted a black rooster, and standing
on guard at each side, was a brave little soldier.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Poodle and his company came in sight,
the two soldiers saluted, then holding their muskets at
present arms, waited for the visitors to approach.</p>

<p>When Mr. Poodle reached the gate, he lifted the heavy
knocker and gave three loud raps. At the third rap the
gate swung open, and there they were right on the edge
of the Kingdom of Toyville, with the sounds of the city
coming faintly through the hills from far down in the little
Valley of Happiness. <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span></p>

<p>Mr. Poodle now seemed very much surprised and the
look in his eyes showed that he was also a little worried.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Mr. Poodle?” asked Tommy, kindly.
“Haven’t we come the right way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Poodle, “this is the right road to
Toyville; but I am very much surprised that none of the
Toy people are waiting to meet us. I expected to find a
company of cavalry at this gate and even thought the
Mayor and some of the Nobles would come to escort us
to the city. It is certainly most strange that no one is here,
for I sent a Messenger to tell them we were coming. It is
not at all like the Toy people to treat guests in this way.
I hope the Messenger has not been captured by the bold
brigands or bandits.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>When Mr. Poodle stopped speaking, Tommy and Helen
thought they heard someone laughing behind a clump of
bushes not far away; but as Mr. Poodle either did not
hear it, or if he heard, he paid no attention, they said nothing
about the matter, but followed him through the gate
and into the new land.</p>

one chapter, and tell of what happened to
that little Messenger Peter Poodle had sent
on ahead to Toyville.</p>

<p>It would have been as well for Peter Poodle
and his happy company to have searched
a little in the bushes, before travelling further on their
journey. Had this been done, it is more than probable it
would have led to a surprising discovery.</p>

<p>When Mr. Poodle told Tommy and Helen that the King
of Grumbletown had ruffians and bandits lurking about,
spying in the hills, he spoke what was
certainly true, but <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
he told only one half of the story. He did not know that
Red Beard had sent not only his bandits, but also his three
bold and crafty Buccaneers, who, having recently returned
from a pirate cruise, were anxious for a little fighting and
plundering on land.</p>

<p>Now, as oft happens in this world, a body sometimes
has Luck tripping along for his wayfellow, and sometimes
it is Ill Luck that goes kicking up the dust at his side. Ill
Luck was the fellow that went travelling with the Messenger
Peter Poodle had sent to Toyville, and this is what
happened: No sooner had the three Buccaneers entered
the Hills of Troubleland than they saw coming down the
road, the little Messenger.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” cried Big Bill, the captain, “here is our chance to
take a captive!” Then he ordered his men to advance,
and the next minute the messenger was captured and
Big Bill had found the message to the Mayor of Toyville.</p>

<p>The captain of the three Buccaneers was not much at
spelling out letters, so it took him a long while to get to
the end of the message. But finally, after reading it all, he
laughed long and loudly.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha! my hearties,” said he (which is the way a
Buccaneer captain always speaks to his men when there
is something of importance afoot). “Ha, ha, ha! Here is
a fine kettle of fish for sure and certain, and all ready to
be cooked! I guess we are the fellows to do the cooking,
too! Listen, my hearties: Peter Poodle, that little toymaker
from over the hills, is going to visit Toyville. Here is a
message he sends to the Mayor, and it says he is going to
bring a boy and a girl with him. What do you think our
King in Grumbletown would
say to that?” <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span></p>

<p>The two Buccaneers looked at Big Bill, their captain, and
neither one knew what to answer.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, my hearties, what our King would say.
He would say, ‘We don’t want any boy and girl going to
Toyville to teach the Toy people new tricks, so Bill, you
must capture them.’ That is what the king would say.
Now, what I want to ask, my hearties, is this: how are we
going to make the capture?”</p>

<p>The two Buccaneers again looked at Big Bill, and again
neither one could answer.</p>

<p>Big Bill thrust his two hands into his pockets and walked
to and fro in deep thought. Finally a bright idea came to
him. “I have it now, my hearties,” he said. “We must find
a good place to hide by the roadside, and make an ambush;
then when they pass by, most likely this boy and girl will
be lagging along behind, looking at the sights, and we can
spring out and take them by surprise; after that we will
carry them captive to Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>The two Buccaneers looked at each other with eyes almost
bulging out of their heads. “My, oh my, Bill, but you
certainly are a fine one at making plans!” they said. Then
taking hold of Big Bill’s hands the three began to dance
and skip about like crazy people.</p>

<p>Big Bill now unfastened the bonds of the Messenger, and
bowing politely to him, said he was very sorry they had
treated him so harshly. “You see,” said he, “there are so
many ruffians and bandits lurking about in the hills, we
have to be careful whom we allow to pass. We hope you
will forgive us, and that you will accept our invitation to
have something to eat before travelling any further along
the road to the city of Toyville.” <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span></p>

<p>Big Bill spoke to the Messenger, just the politest that
could be, for he wanted to get rid of him without his
being suspicious, and yet he wanted to delay the delivery
of the message until its arrival would be too late for the
Mayor to send anyone to meet Mr. Poodle.</p>

<p>The Messenger said he certainly would be glad to have
something to eat with Big Bill and his companions, and as
for blaming them for handling him so roughly, he could
never think of doing that, because he knew it must be
important to have such good guards in Toyville to protect
the city from the wicked ruffians of Grumbletown.</p>

<p>The two Buccaneers expected Big Bill would give the
Messenger a good drubbing for speaking that way, but
though their captain looked a little glum, he did no more
than order them to build a camp fire and prepare a good
dinner. After eating a hearty meal, the Messenger thanked
Big Bill for the entertainment and again took up his journey
down the road to Toyville.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Big Bill and one of his men set out to find a good place
for the ambush, the other Buccaneer was left behind at
the gate to watch for the expected visitors so he could
warn Big Bill of their approach. His laughing was the
sound that Helen and Tommy heard when Mr. Poodle
expressed the hope that his little Messenger had not been
captured by bandits.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i041b.jpg" width="392" height="442" alt="N"></span>O sooner had Helen and Tommy walked
through the gateway than a peculiar shivery
feeling went running up and down their
backs, and even to the tips of their fingers
and toes. This lasted only for a second or
two, and its cause they could not guess.
Indeed, there was no time to give the matter any thought
before something very strange happened. When Captain
Pinkle, Captain Poddle and the others passed through the
Toyville gateway, quick as a wink, every one of them
grew to be as big as Tommy and Helen. At first Tommy
and Helen thought it was themselves that had become as
small as the Toy people, but after looking
around a little, <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
it could easily be seen that their companions were really
the ones who had changed.</p>

<p>“Duck your heads, everybody!” cried Mr. Poodle; “here
comes a cloud that will knock your hats off!” And sure
enough, there was a great fleecy white cloud, like a big
ball of thistle down, rolling and tumbling across the sky,
and so close to their heads that Tommy and Helen could
almost touch it by stretching out their hands.</p>

<p>“This must be a very high hill,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Mr. Poodle. “Why it is nearly
as high as the sky.” Then he asked Tommy to line up the
soldiers, and said he would fire a salute so the Toyville
people would know of their arrival.</p>

<p>After the salute had been fired, the company resumed
their journey, and as there was no longer any danger of
losing the way, Mr. Poodle bade the soldiers take the lead.
Tommy and Helen were sure that they had again heard
someone laughing in the bushes, but as Mr. Poodle paid no
attention, the matter was soon forgotten. A funny curly
road ran down over the hillside, twisting and turning and
bobbing here and there, just as if it wanted to get into as
many nooks and corners as possible, which was not a bit
of wonder either, for nowhere in all the world could be
found a hillside as beautiful.</p>

<p>“We must now travel down this long curly road,” said
Mr. Poodle. Then he asked Helen and Tommy if they
were glad they had come on the journey and if they were
getting at all tired.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, we are glad, Mr. Poodle,” said Helen and
Tommy, both speaking at once. “And we are not the least
tiny
bit tired, either.” <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span></p>

<p>“That is good,” said the little toymaker. “It is a long
walk down the hill to the city of Toyville, but I think you
will not mind that, for there are so many new sights to
be seen.”</p>

<p>At first the road wound through a grove of beautiful
trees thickly covered with sweet blossoms of every color
of which a body might think. Then it entered a wonderful
orchard, where were rows and rows of trees all loaded
with ripe fruit. Fruit? Well, that is what it was called in
Toyville, but over across the hills, back where Helen and
Tommy lived, it would be called candy. There were
bonbons, all of cream and chocolate; there were lovely
fat white marshmallows, luscious and ripe, which hung in
big juicy clusters, waiting to be picked; there were sugar
plums, the finest and biggest that grow on trees anywhere
in the land. Not a single tree in the whole orchard but
what had this fine fruit all bursting ripe, and so much on
every branch and twig that they were almost breaking off
and tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>Two funny little men were seen gathering the fruit in a
great wooden tray with long handles. “Pick all you want,”
they said to Tommy and Helen. “Eat all you want, too.
It will not make you a bit ill, as city candy would, and
for every one we pick, two grow in its place.”</p>

<p>The men did not have to say those words twice. Indeed,
they hardly had time to say them even once, before Helen
and Tommy were under the trees and stuffing their
pockets bursting full; what they couldn’t put in theirs they
stuffed in Rolie Polie’s, which were very big and held
almost as much as a quart. The grass that grew between
the trees of the orchard was nearly as soft
as velvet, and <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
when any of the ripe fruit fell to the ground, it didn’t get
at all broken. There were some shade trees growing in
the orchard, too. Mr. Poodle said they were planted there
to keep the warm sun from shining on the fruit daytimes,
because the sun might make the fruit melt.</p>

<p>“These fleecy white clouds also help to keep the sun
off,” said Mr. Poodle. “That is why they are so big.”</p>

<p>“I thought clouds made it rain,” said Tommy. “Don’t the
clouds make it rain, Mr. Poodle?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Mr. Poodle, “of course that is the way it
is back in our land, but here it never rains. You see the
Toy people do not like to be out in the wet; it would spoil
their games and all their fun, so here it is always sunshiny.”</p>

<p>“And can the Toy people play out of doors all the time?”
asked Helen. “Don’t they ever need to go in the house,
Mr. Poodle?”</p>

<p>“Not on account of rain, dear,” answered Mr. Poodle.
“Of course people go in their houses to sleep at night, but
the Toy boys and girls are never called in to go to bed at
half past seven, just when they are having the most fun;
their mothers allow them to stay up until almost nine
o’clock, or at least until eight.”</p>

<p>Tommy and Helen thought that it would be fine to live
in that kind of a city, and told Mr. Poodle they know the
Toy children must be very happy.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Mr. Poodle. “I am sure the Toy
children are happy; everyone in Toyville is happy.”</p>

<p>While Tommy and Helen were talking in this way with
Mr. Poodle, the road went on twisting about a bend and
presently brought them into a rolling bit of pasture land,
strewn with buttercups and daisies. But that
was not all <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
the pasture contained. No, for, feeding beside a red pump
was a pink barley pig, also some barley cows, and sheep,
and at the far end of the pasture were two tame barley
deer. A barley rabbit, startled by the approaching footsteps,
went skipping across the road, almost under the
very toes of Rolie Polie. My, but Rolie Polie was scared,
and stopped so quickly that he almost tumbled and tucked
his nose in the dust before he could get his balance.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i045.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="In the Pasture."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The little clown then began to laugh and the next minute
away he went over the hedge and through the pasture,
chasing the rabbit as fast as ever his legs could carry him,
with never a thought for danger.</p>

<p>Now Rolie Polie was dressed in his clown’s suit of red
and white; and no sooner did he enter the pasture than
one of the animals lifted its head and gave
a great bellow. <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span></p>

<p>“Oh, the bull, the barley bull!” yelled Mr. Poodle. “Look
out, Rolie Polie! Run for a tree, or the bull will catch you!”</p>

<p>But Rolie Polie was thinking only of the rabbit and
squirrel, and never once heard the barley bull until it was
almost upon him. Mr. Poodle now knew that one of two
things would surely happen: either Rolie Polie would be
overtaken by the bull, or, in trying to escape, he would
be forced to the edge of the cliff and tumble over.</p>

<p>“We must hurry to the rescue!” cried the little toymaker,
and with one bound he went through the hedge, quickly
followed by Tommy. Helen stood and watched them
from the roadway. She would have gone to the rescue
too, but really, barley bulls are very scary animals, and
as Helen had on her red dress, she thought it best not to
get too near.</p>

<p>The bull was now only a few yards behind Rolie Polie,
and all the shouting of Mr. Poodle and Tommy made not
the least bit of difference to its mad gallop. It saw only
the bright colors of the little clown’s costume, and madly
bellowing, it never slackened its speed one tiny particle.
Indeed, the shouting may have made it run even faster.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>What then happened to the little clown must be told in
the next chapter, for now we are at the end of this one.</p>

Rolie Polie chased the barley rabbit,
and in turn was being chased by the barley
bull, Big Bill and his two Buccaneers were
lying in ambush further down the road. The
one who had been left up the hill at the
gate, had hidden behind some bushes, and
when the company came through and Mr. Poodle spoke
of the strangeness of their not being met by any of the
Toy people, he chuckled so loudly, that it was a wonder
the noise did not lead to his being discovered. After the
salute had been fired and the company started on their
downward journey, the Buccaneer, when he saw how the
soldiers were sent on ahead, leaving
Helen and Tommy <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
no greater protection than that afforded by the little old
toymaker and Rolie Polie, again laughed out loud; and it
was only when the company passed from sight that the
Buccaneer left his hiding place and set forth by a short
cut, which soon brought him to the ambush and his waiting
companions.</p>

<p>When Big Bill heard how the company had been divided,
he said: “Didn’t I tell you so? Didn’t I say that that boy
and girl would have to be lagging along behind to see the
sights? I tell you, I know a thing or two. They can’t fool
Big Bill. Come, my hearties, we must get ready! Every
man see to the loading and priming of his pistols! We
won’t need to fire any shots; the sight of our swords and
pistols will be enough to frighten them. Like as not, at the
first glimpse of us, Peter Poodle and that little clown will
run; then we can capture the boy and girl.”</p>

<p>The tramp of men and horses was now heard coming
around the bend further up the road. “We must lay low,”
said Big Bill, “and keep out of sight until these soldiers
pass; then, we can poke out the muzzles of our pistols and
be ready for the others.”</p>

<p>Hardly had Big Bill finished speaking when to their ears
came the startling sound of a great roaring bellow. One of
the Buccaneers jumped to his feet, his legs shook and
trembled while his face went white as chalk. “It is the
barley bull,” he whispered between his chattering teeth.
Again they heard the bellow, this time nearer than before.
“Listen! listen!” cried the frightened Buccaneer, his voice
no more than a hoarse croak; “listen, Big Bill, it is the
barley bull; the barley bull is after us!” Then his legs
giving way, he fell in a heap
on the ground. <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span></p>

<p>Big Bill jumped to his feet. “Are you crazy?” he cried.
“The barley bull can’t hurt you. He is in the pasture up
the hill.”</p>

<p>Presently, the bellow came again, and now so near that
even Big Bill trembled and turned pale, and shaking and
shivering he drew his pistol, while his two men, their faces
blanched with fear, fell on their knees, and frantically
clasped their arms about his knees.</p>

<p>The bellowing of the barley bull now came to them
again and roared in their ears like rolling thunder. “He
will get us, he will get us!” cried the three. “We must run
for our lives!” Then they heard a crash in the bushes
above them and the next second something landed right
on the head of Big Bill, tumbling him and his companions
over and leaving them sprawling on the ground.</p>

<p>The breath was knocked out of Big Bill. He could not
speak even in a whisper. “He has us, he has us; the barley
bull has us!” was what he tried to say, but never a single
word came over his parched lips. Then with the last
ounce of strength that remained in their bodies, Big Bill
and his two men got on their feet and started to run as
fast as ever their shaking legs could carry them. Never
once did any of them stop for even a second to look back,
and I very much doubt if they heard the shouts of Captain
Pinkle and Captain Poddle and their soldiers, or even
heard the reports of the musket shots that were being
fired. No, they thought the barley bull had come through
the bushes tearing after them; which was too much for
the bravery of these three bold Buccaneers.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t the barley bull that had tumbled the three
Buccaneers to the ground; it was a
no more harmful <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
creature that had come crashing through the trees, to
land on their broad backs, than the little clown, Rolie Polie.
If Big Bill and his two fellows had seen Rolie Polie sitting
on the ground and laughing at their hasty retreat, it certainly
would have made them more angry than they were
now scared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, having seen Rolie Polie jump, Mr. Poodle
and Tommy hurried back to the roadway, and, followed
by Helen, ran hurriedly down and around the bend.</p>

<p>“Have you found Rolie Polie? Is he hurt? Has he any
joints broken?” called Mr. Poodle the moment he came in
sight of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Captain Pinkle, “Rolie Polie is not hurt
and he certainly has served us well this day, by saving
Miss Helen and Master Tommy from the Grumbletown
Buccaneers.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Poodle looked at the ambush, and realized
how near Helen and Tommy had come to being captured,
he was very thankful for such a lucky escape. “We must
keep together the rest of the journey,” he said to the two
captains. “These Buccaneers will get over their fright by
and by, and you may be sure they won’t give up trying to
capture Helen and Tommy; so we must be continually
on the lookout for another attack.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Finding that Rolie Polie was not at all hurt by his tumble,
and that the jolly little fellow was well able to travel, the
company formed in line and again started down the road
towards the City of Toyville.</p>

the little Messenger from Peter Poodle
arrived in Toyville, he went at once to the
residence of the Mayor.</p>

<p>“You have a message from Mr. Poodle,”
said the Mayor, as soon as he had shaken
hands with the Messenger. “You are most
welcome to our city; and we are glad, indeed, to receive
any word our good friend Mr. Poodle has to send us.”</p>

<p>While the Mayor was reading the message he grew very
excited. “You must excuse me,” he said to the Messenger.
“Just make yourself comfortable, and at home. This is a
very important word you have brought me,
and I must <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
assemble my councillors. Our city will be greatly honored
by a visit from such a renowned toymaker as Mr. Poodle.
And, at the same time, to have a visit from the boy and
girl who are accompanying Mr. Poodle, that, dear sir, is an
occurrence of the utmost importance, and one for which, I
am sure, my councillors and the Lords and Ladies of the
realm will wish to prepare an exceptional welcome.”</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i056.jpg" width="600" height="339" alt=""></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>There was now much excitement in the council room,
and soon the Heralds were sent speeding here and there
throughout the city to warn the people of the approaching
visitors. The lack of time to make plans did not prevent
their being made thoroughly. What these plans were, we
shall see presently.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Poodle and his little companions, when their
journey had brought them about half way down the curly
road, they came to a place where there was a little lane,
or grassy opening
in the trees. <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span></p>

<p>Mr. Poodle said: “Run down this lane and take a peep
out through the trees over the edge of the hill.”</p>

<p>Helen and Tommy did as Mr. Poodle had suggested and
soon reached the end of the lane, where a look-out could
be had over the brow of the hill. Never before had they
seen such a wonderful sight, for below in the valley lay as
handsome a little city as was to be found in all the world.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i057.jpg" width="600" height="430" alt="The Castle."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>In the foreground could be seen a beautiful lake, and sailing on its
crystal waters were all manner of lovely boats with pennants waving
and flags flying. Entering the lake, at its upper end, hidden here and
there by overhanging trees, was a curly, twisting river. At the lower
end of the lake there tumbled a dashing, foaming waterfall, beside
which rumbled the wheel of a quaint little mill. <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span></p>

<p>Mr. Poodle, who now stood back of Helen and Tommy,
said that in the quaint little mill there lived the jolly little
Miller of Dee, who all day long ground barley corn to feed
the barley animals they had seen in the pasture up on
the hillside. Helen and Tommy could hear the wheel
mumbling very plainly and could even hear the mill grinding.
“Look,” said Mr. Poodle, “there is the little Miller of
Dee!” And sure enough, there he stood in the doorway,
the long smock upon his back, and the cap upon his head,
powdered thickly with barley dust.</p>

<p>All about the edge of the lake there was a turned over
marble rim, and every little way along this rim, were pots
and vases in which grew flowering shrubs and plants,
laden with beautiful blossoms. Here and there had been
built wide stairways, leading down to the very edge of
the water, and in one place there was a long pier standing
on carved and turned posts painted in pretty colors. On
a gate, at the entrance to this pier, were letters which
Helen and Tommy could see, and with much difficulty
spell into words: these read—“Royal Boat Landing.”</p>

<p>Back of the lake the land was rolling and wavy, like
little hills. On these hills there were some fine houses, all
set about with trees, and each one having at its side, or in
the front, or back, a beautiful flower garden. There were
so many of these gardens everywhere, that it was easy to
see that the people were very fond of pretty flowers and
delighted in having them about their homes.</p>

<p>Precisely in the center of the city was one little hill
higher than all the rest, on the tip top of which loomed a
beautiful castle, circled all about with high walls and
topped
with crimson towers. <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span></p>

<p>People could be seen hurrying to and fro in the streets.
They were all as nice looking people as one would ever
wish to see; in fact they seemed just like toys, only much
bigger; as big indeed, as Helen and Tommy. All of the
houses, the boats and even the fine castle on the hill looked
like toys too, only ever and ever so much larger.</p>

<p>“How do you like this sight?” asked the little toymaker.
Helen and Tommy were so excited and so full of wonder
that they were unable to find a single word to put on their
tongues so they could answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle was not a bit fooled by their silence, though,
for being a very clever man, when he looked into their
eyes, he could see them brimming full of joy, so much,
that it was almost bubbling out and running over. That
made it easy enough, then, for a clever man like him to see
that they thought everything just fine.</p>

<p>Of course Helen and Tommy could have said those
words to Mr. Poodle, only they wanted to find bigger
ones. But Mr. Poodle was not even one tiny mite provoked
at their not answering his question, for he thought it much
nicer to read such a happy answer in their eyes. “Come,”
said Mr. Poodle, “it is time to be going! We have passed
through the Hills of Troubleland and entered the Vale of
Joy and the Valley of Happiness; we are now almost in
Toyville.”</p>

<p>“Toyville! Toyville!” cried Helen and Tommy, dancing
with joy. “Hurrah for Toyville!”</p>

<p>Then from the roadway came the happy cry of Captain
Pinkle and Captain Poddle and all their soldiers.</p>

<div>“HURRAH FOR TOYVILLE!”</div>

<p id="p060">The last of the cheer had hardly finished echoing in the
hills when there came an answering cheer from down
the road, and presently, turning a bend in the road, the
little company came into a beautiful park at the foot of
the hill and found it thronged with the happy Toy people.</p>

<p>The Mayor quickly stepped forward and shook hands
most cordially with Mr. Poodle. He said the Toy people
were delighted and much honored in having such a famous
toymaker come to visit them. After greeting Helen and
Tommy and presenting Helen with a bouquet of beautiful
roses, he introduced them to the Lords, Nobles and fine
Ladies and Gentlemen that had come riding up on their
prancing steeds, or in their handsome coaches.</p>

<p>As Helen and Tommy were talking busily with their
new acquaintances, the Mayor stood a little to one side
and eyed them critically. There was a happy, pleased
expression on his face, and once or twice he nodded his
head as if in profound approval of something. Then, in a
low tone, so low that hardly anyone could hear him, he
said: “We certainly acted wisely and have made a good
choice; luck has come to us to-day, and if I am not much
mistaken, it means ill luck to our enemy—the King of
Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>Although the Mayor had mumbled these words barely
above a whisper, there were two in that gathering who
heard what was said, and not only heard the words but
understood what they meant.</p>

<p>The first of these two was Mr. Poodle. Of course it was
all right for Mr. Poodle to hear what the Mayor said, and
the twinkle that jumped about in his eyes showed that he
thought a fine surprise awaited
Helen and Tommy. <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span></p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i061.jpg" width="600" height="587" alt="The Police."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The other one who heard was a tall man, wearing a
broad brimmed hat with a long plume. People called him
Long Jim, but did not know him to be the most clever
courtier in all of Grumbletown and the craftiest spy that
King Redbeard had ever sent to Toyville. Not only did
this man understand what the Mayor had said, but by his
sly ways he managed to ask of Peter Poodle’s people a
question here and another there, until
finally he had <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
a complete account of what had happened to the three
Buccaneers. A cunning smile then twisted up the corners
of Long Jim’s mouth, for he thought: “These people think
they have made fine plans to get ahead of the King of
Grumbletown, but they have reckoned without Long Jim.
I will show them a thing or two that will knock their plans
topsy turvy.”</p>

<p>There was now so much noise that Coal Black and
Snow White began to get quite wild and skittish. The two
noble steeds danced about and showed their fine mettle;
but Helen and Tommy sat so firmly in the saddle, that
all the people gave them a long cheer for such a fine
exhibition of riding.</p>

<p>The Mayor looked at this performance with wonder,
and said to Mr. Poodle that he did not think the equal of
that riding could be found in all Toyville, even among the
most skilled soldiers at the barracks of the cavalry. Then
he invited the toymaker to ride in his carriage, and,
bidding Captain Ten Pin of the police to clear the way,
the procession started for the city.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>One remained behind, however, and went hurrying up
the road in search of the three Buccaneers. This was the
man with the big hat, the crafty courtier, Long Jim.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i065b.jpg" width="403" height="442" alt="S"></span>O great was the joy of the Toy people lined
along the way that cheer upon cheer greeted
Tommy and Helen as they drew towards
the city.</p>

<p>At the entrance to Toyville there was another
gate, similar in design to the one at the
top of the hill, only quite a little larger and flanked with
tall red capped towers in which were windows and portholes,
quite the same as in a fortress. On each side of the
gate were huge brass cannons. The Toy people did not
really expect any enemy to attack their city on this side,
fearing only the King of Grumbletown,
whose realm lay <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
beyond the hills at the far end of the valley, but they built
the gate with towers in such a formidable way, thinking
to thus make a more impressive entrance to their city.</p>

<p>The procession now approached the center of the city
by a long avenue which terminated at a beautiful park.</p>

<p>Around the other edge of the park were ranged line
after line of soldiers, both infantry and cavalry, in uniforms
of scarlet and gold, and black and gold, with officers all in
white and gold; the bridles and saddles of their chargers
being richly studded in silver and colored enamels.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the park there stood a great arch of
wonderful design. Across the top of this arch in tall letters
of black, with great curly capitals of red, was painted:
“Welcome to the King and Queen.”</p>

<p>As Tommy and Helen rode their dancing, prancing
horses beneath the Arch of Welcome, there was a mighty
blast by the buglers followed by roar upon roar from a
great firing of cannon. Then the officers waved their
swords and the soldiers and people broke into one wild
glad cheer, while from all over the city could be heard
the joyous peals of ringing bells.</p>

<p>Presently a Herald rode forward and blew three mighty
blasts upon his bugle. Then he cried: “O, ye people of
Toyville, give ear and hear the words that have been
written for ye in the great parchment!”</p>

<p>As soon as the Herald had said this, there stepped up
two Pages, bearing between them a great scroll of parchment,
from which hung many red ribbons and seals.
Behind the two Pages there came a man dressed in a coat
of scarlet, with a long sword at his belt, and a tall hat
upon his head. <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span></p>

<p>The Pages now unrolled the scroll; on it were many
letters of black and red and gold. The man in red put on
his big spectacles and in a loud voice he read:</p>

<p>“Know all men by these presents, that whereas the
Realm of Toyville has been many years without a ruler,
it is decreed that there shall be appointed and crowned,
a King and Queen. Therefore, be it now known to all
men, that the people will have no other to rule over them
than he who across the big hills is called Tommy, and the
maid who bears him company and is called Helen. These
words were here written down, and signed and sealed by
the High Council of the Realm of Toyville.”</p>

<p>Then the man read the long list of names that were
signed to the parchment, and fine and high sounding
names they were, too.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he turned to the people, and in
a loud voice cried out: “Hail to King Tommy! Hail to
Queen Helen!”</p>

<p>“Hail to King Tommy! Hail to Queen Helen!” the
people repeated; and then together in chorus they shouted:
“Long reign King Tommy and Queen Helen!”</p>

<p>At the completion of this impressive ceremony and
when the people had ceased their glad cheering, the Mayor
stepped forward, and, bowing with much courtesy and
grace, informed their Majesties that if they would be
pleased to dismount, it would be his pleasure to conduct
them to the Royal Seats, which had been prepared at the
other side of the park.</p>

<p>When the Mayor had finished speaking, two Pages
approached and held the bridles of Coal Black and Snow
White while the King and Queen dismounted. <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span></p>

<p>The Mayor now walked with their Majesties across the
park to directly opposite the Arch of Welcome, where
had been erected a high platform, beautifully decorated
with garlands of laurel leaves, intertwined with beautiful
flowers, and on which was the Royal Seat.</p>

<p>The Mayor again bowed most courteously.</p>

<p>“Your Majesties,” he said, “we have prepared for your
special pleasure and enjoyment, and as a slight token of
welcome, some of the fine games and sports for which
our people of Toyville are so famous.”</p>

<p>“We thank you for the honor you have shown us,”
responded King Tommy. “My gracious Queen and myself
will be pleased indeed to watch the games of our
beloved subjects.”</p>

<p>The Mayor was exceedingly happy at these words of
the King; he quickly turned to the waiting Herald and
waved his staff, this being the sign that the entertainment
might begin.</p>

<p>The Herald now blew three mighty blasts upon a bugle
and cried: “Let the games commence!”</p>

<p>Of course, Tommy and Helen were greatly surprised
at being made King and Queen. Mr. Poodle was not surprised,
though, and he said that the people were certainly
fortunate in having made such a wise choice. He was sure
too, that Tommy and Helen would make a splendid King
and Queen, and he predicted that their reign would prove
a happy one.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Mayor, “it certainly will if trouble does not come
from the people of Grumbletown.”</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="professor">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i069.jpg" width="600" height="696" alt="Professor Wow Bow"></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>Tommy could see that the Mayor seemed quite a little worried
about what might be done by the Grumbletown <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span> King, and was going to ask him if he feared any
immediate trouble. Before he had time to do this, however, the games
began, and proved so interesting that both Queen Helen and he had to
spend every minute watching them, and could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>From the first number on the program, which was a grand parade,
consisting of a long procession of elephants, camels, lions, tigers
and nearly every animal of which one could think, led by a fine band
and followed by numerous gaily plumed horses and chariots, up to the
last when the Master of Ceremonies introduced Professor Wow Bow and his
marvellously trained dogs, the entertainment proved one long delight.
There was bareback riding, then came feats of tumblings, performing
Jacks, funny Clowns, and every other act of which one might think.</p>

<p>The little man with a funny pig made Tommy and Helen
laugh so much that they almost had to cry; or at least,
they had to wipe tears out
of their eyes. <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span></p>

<div class="dctr01">

</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>Rolie Polie watched the tricks of the clowns with much
interest, and, although he laughed and applauded generously,
yet it was very apparent that he thought his own
tricks to be quite superior. “They should have a donkey
to ride,” he said to the Miller of Dee, who chanced to be
standing near him. “Now-a-days, we clowns always have
a donkey. When the games are over I will show the
people one or two new tricks that will be thought comical.”</p>

<p>So interested were the people in the performance that
but few of them noticed the entrance into the park of three
men, wearing long coats which were bound about with
broad belts and fastened with big buckles. They were
accompanied by a man in a long red coat, who, after a
moment’s whispered conversation, left them.</p>

<p>These three men now went to the Master of Ceremonies,
and, bowing to him, the tall one said: “We are strolling
Musicians and we desire to play one of our famous tunes
for their Majesties.” <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span></p>

<p>“So, you want to play to the King and Queen, do you?”
asked the Master of Ceremonies. “Well, what tune can
you play?”</p>

<p>“Oh we play upon horns,” answered the big one, poking
the end of the instrument out from under his coat.</p>

<p>“That looks more like a big pistol,” said the Master.</p>

<p>The Musician started at these words, but presently
recovered himself and showed the Master all of the instrument
which in very truth proved to be no more than
a big horn.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>The Master did not like the looks of the men’s faces and
was suspicious of their not being all that they pretended.
Nevertheless, he saw no harm in allowing them to play,
and so led the way across the park to the King and Queen.</p>

the time the three Musicians appeared before
the King and Queen, the entertainment
was at an end, and only the few people
who waited to see the donkey riding of
Rolie Polie remained in the park.</p>

<p>Upon Mr. Poodle hearing that Rolie Polie
proposed to give a performance, he hurried off to find the
little clown, and put an end to his plans. “There is no
telling, your Honor,” he said to the Mayor, “what that little
clown of mine may do; he is apt to be up to all kinds of
tricks, and if he once gets astride his donkey and tries to
perform in this park, something serious is
sure to happen.” <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span></p>

<p>When the Master of Ceremonies told the King about
the three Musicians, King Tommy said: “So three strolling
players have come! well, that is good. We will hear what
kind of music they can play. Bid them tune up and say to
them, we are listening and desire the best selection which
they know how to render.”</p>

<p>The Master delivered the King’s command. Then the
three whispered together, after which they made believe
to tune their instruments, and began to play.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps the three were Musicians and perhaps
the noise the horns made was called music, but it sounded
no better than the howling of three cats; indeed, it sounded
even worse.</p>

<p>“Hold!” cried King Tommy, as he placed a finger in
each ear. “Stop, stop, we have had enough of that music!
If there is no other tune you can play better than this one,
you had best be going, for we can’t stand any more.”</p>

<p>“There is another tune we can play!” cried the big one;
and quick as a wink he and the other two threw away
their horns and thrust their hands under their coats.</p>

<p>Now what tune it was the three Musicians were going to play, I can
do no more than guess; for no sooner did they get their hands inside
their coats, than around the corner of a booth came Rolie Polie,
driving his little donkey in a white and red chariot. The tooting of
the horns had been too much for the donkey, and now the little clown
could do nothing to check its wild gallop as it tore past the people
and straight towards the three Musicians. One loud bray it gave; then
a kick to the right and another to the left, and down went all three
Musicians tumbling heels over head in the dust. <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span></p>

<div class="dctr01" id="stop">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i077.jpg" width="600" height="696" alt="Stop!"></div><!--dctr01-->

<p id="p078">Musicians, did I say? Well, they were musicians no
longer, for beneath the torn and tumbled coat of each
there might now be seen a broad belt holding big pistols
and a keen edged cutlass.</p>

<p>“The three Buccaneers from Grumbletown!” yelled the
Mayor. “Capture them quickly!”</p>

<p>Big Bill was on his feet in a moment. “We are discovered,
we are discovered!” he cried. “Every man run for
his life!”</p>

<p>Hardly were these words off his tongue, when the
three were scurrying across the park and had no sooner
reached the Arch of Welcome, than two of them bounded
to the back of Coal Black, while Big Bill jumped into the
saddle of Snow White, and away they rode like the wind.</p>

<p>The captain and soldiers followed quickly, but there
was no chance of the Buccaneers being overtaken, for
not a horse in Toyville could ever catch Coal Black and
Snow White, even with Coal Black carrying double.</p>

<p>“Which way did the Buccaneers ride?” asked Tommy
of the captain as soon as the soldiers returned.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” answered the captain, saluting the King,
“they are headed for Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>“Grumbletown?” cried the Mayor. “Then we must look
for trouble: Their King will probably declare war.”</p>

<p>“We must post our guards and call out the army,” said
King Tommy. “If the King of Grumbletown makes an
attack, he will find us ready.”</p>

<p>“Is there danger of war, Tommy?” asked Helen, who
had been listening to the talk of the King and Mr. Poodle.
“Because if there is, I think I would like to go home again.
I don’t like battles.” <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Tommy. “You can go up to the
Castle and stay; nothing will harm you there, and it won’t
take me long when I have the Toyville army at my back,
to defeat the soldiers of Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>Helen could see quite plainly that the Mayor and the
captains liked to hear their King talking that way, and
thought him very brave. She thought Tommy was brave
too, when he spoke all those big words; so she said: “May
we go up to the Castle now, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy. “Mr. Mayor will you please lead
the way?”</p>

<p>“I will be glad, indeed, to do so” answered the Mayor;
“and in any event, I think the people at the Castle are
ready, by this time, to serve their banquet.”</p>

<p>“A banquet?” said Helen. “Are we to have a banquet?
Won’t that be lovely!”</p>

<p>This was the second time Rolie Polie’s tricks had proved
lucky for everybody, and it made the little clown quite a
hero. But, although, he received an urgent invitation to
attend the banquet at the castle, he preferred to stroll
about a little with the Miller of Dee, who had invited him
to see the sights of the town, and later to luncheon at the
Barley Mill.</p>

<p>King Tommy at first was not inclined to give his consent
to this plan, for he had been seriously considering a reward
for Rolie Polie, which he intended bestowing at the banquet.
Thinking the reward could wait, however, he gave
the desired permission.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Then the King and Queen stepped into the royal coach,
and followed by the Lords and Nobles, who also were
in fine coaches, started for the Castle. Out of
the park they <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
went, along the broad boulevard, past the barracks of the
cavalry, and on through winding, shady streets; coming at
last to the gateway at the entrance of the Castle Park.</p>

the Buccaneers arrived in Grumbletown
and Red Beard heard what they had
to tell, he began to make new plans. “Yo, ho,
my husky lads!” said he; “so the boy King
of Toyville wasn’t clever enough to capture
you, was he? You hoisted sail and made a
safe passage out of the harbor, did you? Well these are
two fine craft you have brought along, and no mistake
about that; we will find safe anchorage for them in our
own city of Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>Red Beard meant Snow White and Coal Black, when
he spoke of the two craft. He talked in that
way to the <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
three Buccaneers, because once having been a pirate captain,
that is the kind of language he liked best to use.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of thought, Red Beard spoke again.</p>

<p>“Listen, my hearties,” said he, “I have a new scheme to
unfold to you. We can’t afford to have a boy and girl ruling
in Toyville. Do I speak the truth, now?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” answered the three Buccaneers.</p>

<p>“’Tis well,” said Red Beard. “I see you are listening, and
I say, ’tis well.” As he spoke, he tapped with his knuckles
the butt of a pistol that was sticking out of his belt. “No,
we can’t afford to let those Toy people have a boy and
girl for their King and Queen. They will teach them too
much skill and too many tricks, and soon make them so
clever that it will mean the end of Grumbletown. Do I
speak the truth, my bonny babies?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” answered the three Buccaneers.</p>

<p>“’Tis well, I see you listen,” said Red Beard; and again he
tapped the butt of his big pistol. “Now I will give you my
new plan: soldiers and cannon are all right for Kings that
are used to ruling on land, but for a King that once was a
pirate captain, give us a good smart ship and some stout
rogues to man her, and that’s the way to win, say I. What
ho, my hearties?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” cried the three Buccaneers.</p>

<p>“What do you say the King of Toyville will be doing
just now?” asked Red Beard. “He will be eating his fine
banquet up at the Castle with his Queen, won’t he? Well,
then, now is the time to act, say I. Let someone go and
spread the word in Toyville of a big battle, and tell the
Toy people about how their soldiers have been attacked
and how hundreds have
been made prisoners.” <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span></p>

<p>“When the King and his Nobles up at the Castle hear of
this, what will they do? What will they do, I say? Listen,
my sea dogs, and I will tell you what King Tommy and
his Nobles will do. They will mount their horses and ride
out into the hills, and take all the soldiers with them. And
how about Queen Helen? Will any soldiers be left at the
Castle to protect the Queen? No, my husky darlings, no
one will be left to protect the Queen. So, I say, now is our
time to act; King Tommy and his soldiers will be too
clever for us; we can’t fight them, but we can capture the
Queen, and after that it won’t take long before we can
strike up a bargain with the King. Are you listening, my
three little lambs?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” cried the three Buccaneers.</p>

<p>“But,” grumbled Red Beard, as he took a hitch at his belt
and let his sword jingle against the barrel of his pistol,
“when we are rid of the King, how are we going to find a
way to capture the Queen? that’s what I say. How are we
going to capture the Queen?”</p>

<p>No one answered for almost a minute. Then Long Jim
stepped into the room; the crafty courtier had arrived just
in time to hear the King’s question, and, being a clever one,
this is the way he answered:</p>

<p>“If our noble King will permit me to speak, I will tell
the Buccaneers the plan I think our noble and kind King
was about to unfold to them.”</p>

<p>“You may tell them my plan, old Oily Tongue,” replied
Red Beard, for that is the name he had for Long Jim.</p>

<p>Of course, Long Jim knew the King didn’t really have
any plan, and he just pretended, when he offered to tell
what it was, because he thought that
would please Red <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
Beard, who wanted to be thought very clever. Red Beard,
however, knew the smooth ways of Long Jim, and that
is why he called the crafty courtier “Oily Tongue.”</p>

<p>“Most kind and gentle Buccaneers,” said the courtier,
“the King’s plan is this: he wishes you to take your pirate
ship, the Black Rover, and sail through the River into the
Lake at Toyville, where you are to await developments.
Before night comes, you will have the Queen captive.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” answered the three Buccaneers,
marching off to their ship, in which they soon were sailing
down the river towards the Lake of Toyville.</p>

<p>After the departure of the three Buccaneers, Long Jim
and Red Beard put their heads together, and to everything
Long Jim said, the King kept nodding approval, until in
the end, Long Jim bowed good day to Red Beard, and
putting on his feathered cap, he too, set forth for Toyville.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Travelling through the hills by a secret passage, Long
Jim reached Toyville and entered the city without its
once being discovered that he was one of the enemy. As
he went through the streets, he stopped to speak first to
one person and then to another, dropping a word here and
there, which very soon made the people turn pale with
fright and hurry into their houses, where they quickly
barred both doors and windows.</p>

reaching the Castle Tommy and Helen
had been filled with surprise and wonder
at its marvellous beauty. The decorations
were all so rich and so appropriate, that
they could not refrain from expressions of
the warmest admiration. The Lords and
Ladies, too, said they had never seen anything quite so
beautiful.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister met the King and Queen, and when
he had presented them with the Castle, in the name of the
happy people of Toyville, he announced that the banquet
was ready to be served. <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span></p>

<p>After the King and Queen had changed their dusty,
travel stained clothes for the pretty robes that had been
prepared for them, the Lords and Ladies, led by their
Majesties, entered the Royal Dining Room, where were
a number of little tables laden with all manner of good
things. Here the decorations were even more beautiful
than in any other room of the Castle, and when the company
were seated in the quaint chairs at the tables and
partaking of the fine banquet that was served for them,
one and all felt that in no way could they have been
blessed with a more gracious Queen, or a more perfect
hostess.</p>

<p>The first course, as it always should be, was ice cream,
served in many fanciful shapes and of the most delicious
flavors. With the ice cream there was served cake—light,
feathery and perfectly cooked; with just the right amount
of egg, not a bit too much sugar, and flavored to the point
of nicety.</p>

<p>There were many kinds of cake served, so that everybody
might have the special kind which was best liked.
After the cake course, there were cream puffs, luscious
eclairs, thin, delicate sugar wafers, candies, fruits, nuts and
every dainty confection which could be imagined.</p>

<p>The Queen, remembering what she had been told about
the candy fruit in the orchard, that it wouldn’t make them
ill, as city candy did at home, very thoughtfully told her
guests that each might have two helpings of everything,
or even three, or four, if they desired.</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle, thinking it would be a rare treat to the Toy
people to have something from the city over the hills,
reminded the Queen of the chicken
sandwiches and the <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
two rosy red apples. He said these had come safely through
the hills, and had been delivered at the Castle by the driver
of the express wagon.</p>

<p>The Queen hurriedly sent for the sandwiches and the
apples. When these were cut up and served to the guests,
everyone spoke of them in the highest terms of praise,
and said that never before had they tasted quite such a
nice dessert.</p>

<p>It was as plain as it could be that everyone had spoken
the truth, for when the banquet was finished, not as much
as one single crumb of the dessert could be found on
the plates.</p>

<p>During the progress of the banquet, Long Jim, as we
already know, had been busy spreading his news in the
streets of the city.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for this news to travel, I can tell you;
and just as the King and Queen and their guests were
about to rise from the tables, there was a big commotion
in the Castle; and through the open windows were heard
the cries of alarm in the town.</p>

<p>Then the Major Domo came hurriedly into the Royal
Dining Room and announced that the city had been
attacked by the army of Grumbletown.</p>

<p>As may well be imagined, there was now great excitement
in the Castle, and especially, among the Ladies. The
Queen turned anxiously to the King. “Is there going to be
a war?” she asked, “because I don’t want a war; battles
are awfully scarey.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, Helen,” said King Tommy. “Nothing
will harm you. It won’t take us long, with the fine army
of Toyville, to drive the enemy out of the hills
and back to <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
their own Grumbletown.” Then mounting a chair, and
being quickly surrounded by the House Guards, he cried:
“There is no time to be lost; every man will be needed
among the defenders to-day; let every man buckle on his
sword and follow me!”</p>

<p>The Mayor also jumped up on a chair. “A cheer for
Toyville!” he cried; “long may it prosper! Three cheers
for our brave and noble King; long may he reign!”</p>

<p>Everybody joined in the cheering, the sweet voices of
the ladies mingling pleasantly with the strong, lusty shouts
of the men.</p>

<p>But no time had been lost by the cheering; for all the
while the attendants were busy buckling on the swords
and fetching helmets and shields. Meanwhile, the neighing
and stamping of horses in the court outside the Castle,
indicated that the grooms also were busy, and already had
the strong, noble steeds waiting for the brave and fearless
riders.</p>

<p>When the King and his companions reached the streets,
they found everything in commotion, with brave soldiers
galloping here and there, and frightened faces peering
out of the windows of the houses.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” chuckled Long Jim when he saw the King
depart; “I tell you, I am a clever one! That’s the time I
fooled the King of Toyville! And now there is no time to
lose; the Queen is in the Castle without any guards, and
the three Buccaneers in the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover"> will be waiting
out on the lake.” With his face twisted in a wicked grin
the crafty courtier now entered the gates and went through
the quiet, deserted court yard, where presently, with a rap,
tap, tap, he stood waiting at the front door
of the Palace. <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, King Tommy and his companions rode to the
barracks of the cavalry. As might have been anticipated,
it took hard, quick work to get out all the soldiers, cannons
and ammunition wagons, and to issue orders so that everything
would go smoothly. But the King was equal to the
task, and before long, the sound of galloping cavalry,
tramping infantry, and rumbling wheels of cannons and
ammunition wagons, told the frightened Toy people that
the troops were hurrying off to the hills and to the defense
of the realm.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i093.jpg" width="600" height="371" alt="In the Windows."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>When King Tommy had issued all his orders and arranged
every little detail, he mounted a fine war horse,
and asking Mr. Poodle to ride with him, the two with the
King’s Guards set forth at a fast gallop for
the front. But <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
when they came to the hills where the horses were obliged
to walk, the King found time to do a little thinking. The
most he had to think about was the coming battle, but
some of the time he thought of Helen, and wondered if
she would be frightened upon hearing the cannon roaring,
and if she would really be safe in the Castle. He wished
now that he had left more guards at the Castle. “I will be
glad,” he thought, “when the war is over, and I can go
back again to Helen.”</p>

<p>The roads were now one mass of hurrying troops, all in
bright colored uniforms, with the sun glistening on the
polished gun barrels and on the officers’ swords. The King
noticed how willingly the big horses tugged at their heavy
loads, and how the drivers never used their whips, but
always spoke kindly to them.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the front, they found many cannons
mounted on the hills, and company upon company of
soldiers waiting in battle array, but never a sign anywhere
of the enemy.</p>

<p>“Have you sent out scouts?” asked the King to the
Commanding General.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty,” answered the General; “and all
report that none of the enemy can be found.”</p>

<p>“That is strange,” said the King. “How about the prisoners,
have you rescued them?”</p>

<p>“There have been no prisoners taken, your Majesty,”
answered the General; “neither has there been any attack
made upon our outposts.”</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="artillery">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i095.jpg" width="600" height="696" alt="The Artillery"></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>While the King and the General were talking, another
scout came to report. “My General,” said the scout, “I have
ridden to the very walls of Grumbletown,
where I was <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
told by a peasant that the Grumbletown army has not
ventured outside the gates of their city.”</p>

<p>While this scout was reporting, another came riding up
as fast as his horse could gallop.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i096.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="A Scout"></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>“My General,” cried the second scout, “I have come
from the high hills yonder. There is a ship entering the
Lake of Toyville. It is the pirate ship from Grumbletown,
called the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover"> manned by the Buccaneers.”</p>

<p>“We have been tricked!” cried the King. “We have left
the Castle unguarded, and the Queen without protection.
The Queen will be made captive! We must ride to her
rescue!”</p>

<p>“To the Queen’s rescue! To the Queen’s rescue!” cried
an officer of the King’s Guard; and, shaking the reins over
their horses’ necks, a great company of riders led by the
King and Mr. Poodle went galloping
back to Toyville.</p>

Long Jim had time to give a second
rap, tap, tap, the front door of the Castle
opened and a servant in royal livery stood
ready to usher the crafty courtier into the
Audience Hall.</p>

<p>“You may announce to Her Majesty the
Queen, that I come from the King with a very important
message,” said Long Jim.</p>

<p>The servant departed. “Ha, ha, ha,” chuckled Long Jim,
“I certainly am a clever one! I told the man to tell the
Queen I had a message from the King, but I didn’t tell him
it was from the King of Grumbletown; and
he thinks it <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
is from his own King. He does not know what a clever
one I am and how I can fool all of them, but he will find
out very soon.”</p>

<p>“Her Majesty will give you an audience,” announced
the servant, as he returned. Then, he conducted Long Jim
to the Royal Parlors, where the Queen sat surrounded by
her Ladies.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said Long Jim, addressing the Queen,
after taking off his hat and bowing courteously, “the King
sends you greeting, and begs to inform you that the army
of Grumbletown is being held in check and has even been
driven back in some places. He wished me to say to you
that there is no danger at present, and he hopes you and
these noble Ladies will have a good time and enjoy yourselves.
He suggests that you might find it a pleasure to go
for a sail on the lake.”</p>

<p>The Queen was much pleased at this message. She
clapped her hands and said: “O, I dearly love to go sailing!
If it pleases the Ladies to do so, we will go at once.”</p>

<p>The Ladies said they certainly would enjoy taking a sail
on the beautiful lake.</p>

<p>But though the Ladies spoke this way, all in truth were
quite a little afraid, and wondered if it were wise for them
to venture out of the Castle, with the army of Grumbletown
so near the city; they were sure, however, the King
would not have sent such a message unless he knew the
outing to be perfectly safe.</p>

<p>When the Queen and her Ladies had gone to their
apartments to dress in their yachting costumes, Long Jim
took a careful survey of the room to see that there was
nobody near, then he broke into a villainous
laugh. “I have <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
fooled them now,” he said. “King Red Beard will reward
me for this. I tell you, I am a clever one,—too clever for
these numskulls in Toyville! When their King comes
home and finds his Queen gone, won’t he tear around and
be angry though! And won’t he be twice as angry when
he learns she has been betrayed into the hands of the
Buccaneers of Grumbletown! Big Bill, the captain of the
Buccaneers, will say I am a clever one too, when he sees
the boat bearing the Queen and her fine Ladies sailing
away out on the lake. It won’t take Big Bill long to run his
fine ship, the
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">
 <span class="nowrap">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover">,</span>
that flies the black flag, right
alongside of the Queen’s boat, and then in about two jiffies
he will have the Queen and her Ladies made captive. I tell
you I am a clever one to plan all this! Ha, ha, ha! yes, I
certainly am a clever one!”</p>

<p>That was a long speech for the crafty courtier to make,
and he had but little breath left when he finished, so that
his laugh at the end didn’t ring nearly so loud as it did at
the beginning. Lucky for his wicked plans that his laugh
wasn’t so loud either, for he had hardly finished when he
heard the Queen and the Ladies returning.</p>

<p>Bowing again very courteously, Long Jim said: “It is the
King’s wish that I escort the Queen and the Ladies to the
lake. Is this also the Queen’s wish?”</p>

<p>The Queen answered that the ladies and herself would
certainly be pleased to comply with the King’s wishes,
and, as it was yet early in the afternoon, she had no doubt
that all would have a very pleasant sail, and thoroughly
enjoy their outing.</p>

<p>Long Jim thanked the Queen and said he was sure the
sail would prove very entertaining. <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span></p>

<p>When Long Jim said that, if the Queen had but glanced
at his face, she would have seen an expression, sly and
crafty enough to frighten her; for the entertainment which
he meant was of a kind that would not prove very safe
for the Queen.</p>

<p>The Queen, however, had no suspicions, so, telling Long
Jim they were now ready to start, the little company left
the Castle and set forth for the lake. Laughing and chatting
merrily, with never a thought of danger, they came presently
to the Royal Boat Landing.</p>

<p>Two trained sailors rowed them to the
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">
 <span class="nowrap">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.yacht.png" width="188" height="60" alt="Yacht">,</span>
now riding at anchor a little way from the shore. After
assisting the last Lady to step aboard, Long Jim ordered
the sail hoisted, when, a gentle breeze filling the canvas,
the trim boat cut a way through the silver tipped ripples,
and sped rapidly out on the lake.</p>

<p>Long Jim was such a good sailor that Queen Helen
could not help remarking to her companions the pleasure
it gave her to see the boat handled so skilfully. The Ladies
said it pleased them, too, for now they felt perfectly safe
and had not the least particle of fear of anything happening
to cause danger, or to mar the enjoyment of such a nice
afternoon, and such a delightful sail.</p>

<p>Long Jim chuckled to himself when he heard this conversation,
for he thought, “I guess these Ladies would sing
a new tune if they knew how this sail is going to end, and
the Queen would certainly think I am a clever one if she
knew how I have kept the boat headed right up the lake
towards the river, and all the while with the sail set so
not one of them can see that black pirate ship just beyond
the bend.” <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span></p>

<p>But if Queen Helen and her Ladies did not see the pirate
ship, the Buccaneers saw their ship, and now ran up their
long black flag; and steering a course for the mouth of the
river, drew the sail taut, so as to catch every particle of
the breeze and went scudding out of the river into the
lake, laying their course straight for the
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">
<span class="nowrap">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.yacht.png" width="188" height="60" alt="Yacht">.</span></p>

<p>“Down with the helm!” cried Big Bill. “Run out the
cannon, take careful aim, I will touch the fuse, and we will
put a round shot across their bow, that will make them
stop, I think. Then we can run alongside and board their
vessel. Every man to his post! There now, are you ready?”</p>

<p>“All ready!” yelled the two Buccaneers. “Fire!”</p>

<p>No sooner was the word uttered than there sprang from
the mouth of the cannon a flash of flame, followed by a
great puff of black smoke and a mighty rumbling roar, like
thunder. Then skipping through the water, not ten feet
before the bow of the
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.yacht.png" width="188" height="60" alt="Yacht"> went the big ball,
sending up sheets of spray which spattered the deck of
the yacht and even reached the little group seated in the
cockpit.</p>

<p>The Queen and her Ladies screamed with fright, which
certainly was no more than natural, for they were taken
very much by surprise. Before any of them could utter
one single word, Long Jim threw over the helm and headed
the yacht into the wind so that in a moment it lost
headway and drifted with the sail flapping useless in the
breeze.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pirate ship drew rapidly nearer, and
presently swung about and came alongside. The Buccaneers
then threw grappling irons on to the deck of the
yacht, and lashed the
two boats together. <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span></p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha! We have them now!” laughed Big Bill.
“Come, my little birds, which one is your Queen?”</p>

<p>Not one of the Ladies answered Big Bill. No one would
be so disloyal as to betray the Queen, and none of the
Ladies, at least none of the Royal Ladies, would ever stoop
so low as to speak to a pirate.</p>

<p>Long Jim quickly stepped forward. “This is the Queen,”
he said as he pointed to Helen. “Take her and don’t bother
with the others. That cannon shot of yours is sure to alarm
the whole town, and we will have to make rapid work of
it, if we get away safely. You were a stupid old noodle
head to make such a noise.”</p>

<p>Big Bill scowled and drew his pistol when Long Jim
said this.</p>

<p>“A stupid old noodle head, am I? Well, that shows how
much you know about pirating. Did you ever hear of a
pirate capturing a ship without firing a shot across her
bow? Answer that now, if you can.”</p>

<p>But Long Jim, when he looked into the muzzle of the
pistol, didn’t care to say any more, so he jumped across to
the deck of the pirate ship and left Big Bill, who was not
long in capturing Helen.</p>

Long Jim said the shooting of the cannon
would alarm the whole town he told but
the truth. It did more than that however, for
it warned King Tommy and Mr. Poodle that
it was the lake and not the castle to which
their company must ride, thus saving them
much valuable time. What a clatter the horses did make
galloping through the town; out of one street and into another
they went, all the while willingly straining in every
muscle to attain the utmost speed of which they were capable,
seemingly realizing the great anxiety of their riders.
King Tommy rode at the head of the column, his sword in
his fist, his head thrown back and his hair
blowing in the <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
breeze, while he shouted words of encouragement to his
followers, bidding them keep stout hearts and strong arms
for the defence of the city, and the rescue of their Queen.</p>

<p>When presently the little company came to the lake, the
good horses bore them almost into the water before their
mad gallop could be checked; and then only by pulling the
fiery steeds back on their haunches were the brave riders
saved from getting a good ducking.</p>

<p>It was the work of only a moment to dismount. What
to do next the King did not quite know, for already those
on the pirate craft were casting off their grappling irons,
and as soon as the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover"> could get free from the

<span class="nowrap">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.yacht.png" width="188" height="60" alt="Yacht">,</span>
with a piping breeze filling her sails she
would soon reach the mouth of the river, when all hope of
capture would be lost. Being such a cunningly built craft,
and drawing so little water, under the skilful handling of
the Buccaneers, the tortuous bends of the river would be
navigated through shallow and twisting channels where
no other ship could follow.</p>

<p>“If we only had a gunboat,” said the King, “I could go into
the conning tower and direct the shots, so as to rake that
pirate ship fore and aft, and in about a minute sink her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would no doubt be the right thing to do,” said
Mr. Poodle, “provided there are no captives aboard. But—”</p>

<p>“Do you think they have captured Queen Helen?” said
Tommy, never once realizing how he had interrupted the
words of Mr. Poodle. “See! There are ladies in the
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">

<p>Row boats were now quickly boarded, and with stout
men tug­ging most man­ful­ly at the oars, were made to skip
over the wa­ter at no slow rate, and so
reached the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">

dis­tance to the river. It could now be seen with one glance
that the Queen had been cap­tured, and even this was not
required, as the ladies were excitedly cal­ling the news the
moment the boats came within hail­ing distance.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i109.jpg" width="600" height="399" alt="Off to the Yacht."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>King Tommy and Mr. Poodle were the first to reach the
abandoned yacht, and without waiting for the others, they
sprang quickly to the sail and the helm, and soon had the
boat headed for the river and chasing the pirates’ craft.</p>

<p>The <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.yacht.png" width="188" height="60" alt="Yacht"> was a good sailer, and under some
con­di­tions might have over­hauled the

 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover">.</span> But
now, King Tommy saw such a task to be hopeless and that
the Buccaneers would enter the river before there was any
chance of their being overtaken. The only hope lay in a
shot from the yacht cannon, and as this
meant danger to <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
the Queen, it was no sooner thought of than abandoned.
Meanwhile the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover"> had reached the mouth of
the river, and Big Bill, in glee at his successful capture of
the Queen and no less successful escape from the King,
trained his brass cannon on the fast approaching yacht and
fired a parting shot. Buccaneers are usually fine shots, but
from a careless aim, due probably to excitement, the cannon
ball went wide, never coming within yards of doing
any harm. This it did do, however: it showed to the King
the danger of continuing the pursuit, especially when fear
of hitting the Queen made it unwise to return the fire.</p>

<p>By this time the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">

bend in the river. Once past that there would be no hope
of rescuing the Queen. The Buccaneers were again training
their cannon on the approaching yacht, this time with
a more determined aim, and Tommy, as he stood manfully
at the helm, felt for the first time that he had been beaten,
and for the safety of the ladies aboard the yacht he should
keep out of range of the next shot. Quickly throwing over
the helm, he allowed the yacht to head up into the teeth
of the wind, and gave up the chase. Hardly had the yacht
changed her course before there was a flash and a boom
from the deck of the

through the water only a few feet astern, drenching King
Tommy with a sheet of spray. But for this quick maneuver,
the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">

be­low the water line and sunk.</p>

<p>When the Buccaneers now saw that the chase had been
abandoned they waved their hats and shouted in wildest
glee, and the next minute, reaching the bend in the river,
were lost to sight behind
the overhanging trees.</p>

King had chosen the only course possible.</p>

<p>Tommy now held a consultation with Mr. Poodle. In
their hurried talk neither one could present a plan which
promised success, or even held any hope. Meanwhile, the

no danger from the cannon shots, the yacht was again
headed for the river, though what would be gained by
this course the King for a moment could not see.</p>

<p>During this activity on board the yacht, there had been
no less activity on the land, for the sound of the firing had
brought a great gathering of people to the shore of the
lake, to the roofs of houses and to every high point from
which might be had a good view.</p>

<p>Now, as has been told, Rolie Polie had gone off to see
the town and have luncheon with the Miller of Dee. Thus
it happened that when the Buccaneers fired their first
cannon shot, the little clown was sitting at the door of the
mill, watching the great wheel turn and the barley corns
go bobbing up and down in the hopper.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho, Rolie Polie,” cried the Miller of Dee; “there
must be a battle out on the lake! Come in and tend the
mill a minute, while I go up on the roof and see what is
causing all this firing!”</p>

<p>Rolie Polie jumped quickly to his feet, and didn’t say no
to that proposition, I can tell you, for he thought it would
be great sport to tend the mill. Presently the Miller of
Dee was telling him to turn this lever this way, and that
lever another way, and to be sure not to touch the third
lever, and then the mill would grind, or stop grinding, and
all would be well. “Be sure, Rolie Polie, not to touch the
third lever,” finally cautioned the Miller, as he went hurrying
out of the door.</p>

<p>After Rolie Polie had tended the mill for a while, he too
began to wonder what was happening out on the lake.
“I will shut off the mill,” said he, “and get up on the roof
and see.” <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span></p>

<p>“Now, was it this lever the Miller said to turn, or that
one, or the third one?” wondered Rolie Polie. Then he
pushed down a lever, and no sooner had it turned than
Rolie Polie heard a great rushing and roaring which nearly
shook the mill from off its foundations.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rolie Polie!” cried the Miller’s wife, scaring her cat
from its nap in the sun, as she ran hurriedly into the mill,
“What have you done? What have you done? The gates
to the dam are open and the water is tearing wildly
through the mill brook. We must turn the lever again
and shut the gates!”</p>

<p>But, work as hard as they could, the gates would not
budge one inch, and presently the Miller was heard
calling loudly: “Shut the gates! Shut the gates!”</p>

<p>Rolie Polie began to shake and tremble. “I think it is
time for me to go and hide,” he said. “There is no telling
what the Miller might do.” Then off he hurried and soon
had tucked himself in a corner behind some meal bags.</p>

<p>“Shut the gates! Shut the gates!” yelled the Miller, as he
bounded through the open door and ran across the mill to
the levers. But for all his hard tugging, the Miller of Dee
never closed the gates even one particle. Then he went
outside and called for help, and presently there was no
less than a dozen stout Toy people tugging at the lever,
which little by little, as the pressure of the water grew
less, began to turn and finally shut the gates.</p>

<p>“It is a fine mess this little clown has made for us now,”
said the Miller. “He deserves to have a good birch twig
laid upon his back, only, of course, that is against the laws
of Toyville, and besides he is such a jolly little fellow, it
would be a shame to give
him a whipping.” <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span></p>

<p>While the little Miller of Dee was talking this way,
Rolie Polie, now much frightened, kept creeping further
into his nook behind the barley bags.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i116.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt=""></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>If he had not been so intent upon hiding he would have
heard the Miller laugh and say that: “Perhaps the little
clown was not after all much to blame, for he hadn’t had
much experience at mill tending.” That was the way it
was with the Toy people; they never could be cross with
anybody, or, at least, they could not be cross for long.</p>

<p>Rolie Polie did not hear the Miller say this though, but
what he did hear was an approaching throng in the street.
These, with shouts and cries of: “Who opened the gates?
Who opened the gates?” were now almost at the mill.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i117.jpg" width="600" height="696" alt="The Levers."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>As for the little Miller, he too heard the cry. “Oh me,
oh my!” said he, “this certainly looks
threatening for Rolie <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
Polie; and really the fault was not so much his as mine.
I should never have left the mill in his
care.” The next <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
minute the Miller of Dee stepped briskly to the open door.
“I am the one for whom you are looking,” said he.</p>

<p>Whatever the Miller of Dee expected would happen
when he made the announcement, I do not know, but of
this much I am certain, that which did happen was without
doubt a big surprise.</p>

<p>“The Miller of Dee! the Miller of Dee! Hurrah for the
Miller of Dee!” cried the throng as they rushed forward;
and, taking hold of the little Miller, twined a wreath of
roses about his shoulders and placed him on the back of
Rolie Polie’s donkey.</p>

<p>“To the Castle!” they cried; and off they started.</p>

<p>It was as much as two minutes before the little Miller
could get enough breath to speak. “Why am I being taken
to the Castle? Why is this wreath about my neck? And
why do you cheer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried one of the Toy people to his companions.
“The Miller of Dee asks why we cheer! Why shouldn’t
we cheer? Hurrah for the Miller of Dee, who opened the
gates of the dam and let the water out of the lake, so the
pirate ship was left high and dry in the river!”</p>

<p>When, at last, the noise had subsided enough for the
little Miller to be heard, he asked: “Is that what has really
happened? Has the pirate boat been captured and has
Queen Helen been rescued?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the Toy people; “Queen Helen has
been rescued, and all due to the Miller of Dee.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the little Miller, “the honor is not mine;
I did not open the gates. They were opened by the little
clown. Turn back, my fellow Toy people, this wreath of
roses is for Rolie Polie.”</p>

Toy people cheered, and he wondered at
their hasty departure. Then he crawled out
from behind the bags and went to the door
of the mill. There the returning Toy people
found him, his clothes powdered white
with barley meal and his face full of wonderment.</p>

<p>Well, the end of the matter was just this: Rolie Polie,
astride his little donkey and loaded down with garlands
of roses, was carried off to the Castle. By his side walked
the Miller, now wearing his best clothes, and as happy a
little body as there was in
all the town. <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span></p>

<p>On the way the people told him of what had happened,
and how, when the gates were opened, the water ran out
from the lake and made the river so shallow, that the first
thing the Buccaneers knew, the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover"> stranded
high and dry on a gravelly sand bar, with no possible
chance to escape capture.</p>

<p>“But,” interrupted one of the Toy people, “Buccaneers
are clever ones when it comes to getting out of a tight
place, and it did not take them long to climb over the side
of their ship and run for the woods.”</p>

<p>“The four rogues had good legs for running, too,” said
another of the Toy people.</p>

<p>“Had any harm come to Queen Helen?” asked the
Miller of Dee.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” answered one of his companions. “You see

and King Tommy jumped quickly over the side into the
shallow water and was the first to reach the

He found Queen Helen tied to the mast with a rope. The
Queen acted bravely, and the Buccaneers, seeing that she
was no cry baby, did not treat her roughly; for although
they had tied her to the mast, the ropes were not tight
enough to really hurt.”</p>

<p>“Buccaneers always treat brave captives that way,”
said another of the Toy people. “It is only the scarey
ones that they handle roughly.”</p>

<p>“Probably Queen Helen couldn’t help being a little
frightened though,” said the Barley Miller.</p>

<p>“But perhaps she bit her lip and did not show one
single particle of it to the Buccaneers,” said Rolie Polie.
“That would be
just like Helen.” <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said one of the Toy people, “I think she was
somewhat frightened, because that would be enough to
scare any Queen; and when Tommy cut her bonds and
set her free, she looked so glad and so excited, that I think
she would have cried if there had not been so many
people about.”</p>

<p>“When the gates were closed and the lake began to fill,
you should have seen the people on the sand bar run!”
said a Toy man who was walking by the donkey; and then
he laughed long and heartily. “Why, in a jiffy the water
was up to their ankles, and I think it would have soon
been to their knees had they not waded to the shore, or
hastily clambered over the side of the
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">

 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.rover.png" width="207" height="60" alt="Rover">.”</span></p>

<p>“That was a fine race the two boats had back to the
landing pier,” said another Toy man. “The pirate ship is a
fast boat, but I think the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.royal.png" width="228" height="60" alt="Royal">
 <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i102.yacht.png" width="188" height="60" alt="Yacht"> is faster, and I
don’t believe the <img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i092.black.png" width="182" height="60" alt="Black">

for being so skilfully handled. Tommy certainly knows
how to get speed out of a boat.”</p>

<p>When Rolie Polie came into the presence of the King,
and the story was told of how everything had happened,
King Tommy said: “Rolie Polie, you shall have a fine
reward for this; three times your tricks have saved us
sorrow. I am going to give you a medal and make you
Captain of my Royal Guards. Go now and change this
clown’s dress for a new uniform.”</p>

<p>“Your Highness,” said Mr. Poodle, after Rolie Polie had
thanked the King and departed, “I think the Miller of Dee
also deserves a reward, for, from what I hear, he has acted
most nobly; taking blame when he thought that it would
save Rolie Polie, and as graciously
according credit when <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
he found the opening of the gates had brought honor and
the praise of his fellow Toy people.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the King. “I will make the Miller of
Dee my first assistant Prime Minister.”</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i124.jpg" width="600" height="455" alt="The Herald."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>The little Miller thanked the King, then laughed and
said: “I think the place for me is in the mill, simply grinding
my barley corns.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle then told King Tommy that a good Miller
was a very handy fellow to have in the Kingdom, especially
one who had something more beneath his cap than
the dust upon his hair, as without doubt
this one had. <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span></p>

<p>Tommy felt that there might be some truth in what
the toymaker said, but he told Mr. Poodle he thought that
such a noble deed certainly deserved a reward.</p>

<p>“That is true,” replied Mr. Poodle; “and now I would
suggest that, as a reward to the Miller, you make this a
holiday, to be observed every year and to be called the
Miller’s Holiday.”</p>

<p>Tommy said that would be fine, and immediately issuing
the order, Heralds were soon proclaiming it throughout
the city.</p>

<p>The Toy people shouted and cheered at these words
of the Heralds, as they were all fond of holidays, and so
thought the King had found a fine way to reward their
friend, the good Miller of Dee.</p>

<p>As for the Miller, he felt very much embarrassed, but
at last found words to thank the King, and then started off
home to talk it all over with his neighbors. A big man the
Miller was in his neighbors’ eyes now, you may be sure;
all were glad enough to rub shoulders with him, and no
one minded the white barley dust on his clothes, I can tell
you, which was very nice for the little Miller.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three Buccaneers, led by Long Jim, the
crafty courtier, made their way back to Grumbletown.
Their clothes had been badly torn by the wild scramble
through the bushes; while brambles and briars had made
sad havoc with their faces, so that altogether it was four
sorry, dilapidated looking specimens that now appeared
before King Red Beard.</p>

<p>“Blunderheads!” That is what Red Beard called Long
Jim and the three Buccaneers, not once but a dozen times.
Then he called them “noodle skulls,” and, last
of all, he <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
called them “four big cowardly babies,” which certainly
was a hard name to give, even to wicked Buccaneers.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>But, by and by, when Red Beard began to quiet down,
he said: “Well, you have now failed three times, but we
can’t allow that boy and girl to rule in Toyville.” Then
ordering his spies to return to Toyville, he set about the
making of new plans.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i129b.jpg" width="408" height="447" alt="T"></span>HINKING there was now nothing to fear
from an attack by the army of Grumbletown,
the Toyville soldiers were ordered
to return from the hills, and already the
sound of rumbling wheels in the streets,
told how promptly this order had been
obeyed by the Commanding General.</p>

<p>“We have much to make us thankful,” said the Mayor
to one of his councillors. “It certainly would have been a
sad occurrence had the capture of the Queen resulted in
her being carried away to Grumbletown. I think the
occasion demands a celebration, and I
should suggest that <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
we at once prepare a big party to take place on the lawns
and in the pavilions of the Palace gardens.”</p>

<p>“A splendid suggestion,” cried the councillors with one
accord. “Let us lose no time in getting under way the
arrangements.”</p>

<p>The gardens, brilliant with pots of flowering shrubs and
beds of blossoming plants, their broad stretches of lawn
bordered by hedges of box, and interlaced with white
pebbled walks, formed an ideal place for the holding of a
social gathering of this nature.</p>

<p>When to the natural beauty of the gardens there was
added the beauty of the handsome dresses and uniforms
worn by the guests, the scene thus presented proved of
untold loveliness.</p>

<p>In one of the pavilions sat an orchestra which rendered
the most delightful music imaginable; in another pavilion
were many little tables where were served refreshments
of the daintiest confections; in a third pavilion the highly
polished and waxed floor was given over to dancing.</p>

<p>Under such delightful conditions, the King and Queen,
as well as the Lords and Ladies, soon forgot their recent
fears, and with Rolie Polie in his new uniform standing
guard at the front gate, one and all felt perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Outside the walls of the Castle and gardens, the streets
of the city were quiet and almost deserted, for the Toy
people had repaired to the park, where they, too, were
celebrating with all manner of jolly games and sports.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, King Red Beard had not been idle, and by
the time his spies returned to tell how matters were
going in Toyville, he had two hundred picked ruffians
ready to make a last attempt to capture the King and
Queen. <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span></p>

<p>How Red Beard did laugh when his spies told him of
the celebration that was being held in Toyville. “Ha, ha,
ha,” said he, “those Toy people think they have seen the
last of old Red Beard, do they? Well, we will soon show
them their mistake.”</p>

<p>After that it wasn’t long before the Grumbletown King
and his two hundred hardy rascals had travelled through
the secret passage of the hills and were in the quiet,
deserted streets of Toyville.</p>

<p>When the company came near the Castle and could
hear the sweet strains of music and the sound of happy
laughter, King Red Beard sent Long Jim on ahead to spy
how the land lay.</p>

<p>Presently, Long Jim returned. He had taken a peek
here and there, and told Red Beard that there was only
one soldier standing guard at the front gate. “And your
Majesty,” said he, “I think the soldier is that stupid clown,
Rolie Polie, now dressed in the uniform of the King’s
Guard.”</p>

<p>Red Beard gave a wild laugh when he heard what Long
Jim had to say. “Forward, march!” he cried; “we can
easily fool that simpleton.” Then away they all went, and
in two jiffies Red Beard was tapping at the front gate and
parleying courteously through the wicket with Rolie Polie.</p>

<p>Now, the kernel to the nut Red Beard tried to crack on
Rolie Polie’s skull, was just this: he wanted to have the
gates opened so he and his two hundred tatterdemalion
followers could enter the gardens and capture all the
people.</p>

<p>Red Beard was good at arguing and gave all manner of
reasons, but none of these availed him in
the least, for <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
Rolie Polie, now very proud of being a King’s Guard,
would never think of doing anything untrue to his trust.</p>

<p>At the last, when Red Beard was about ready to give
up trying trickery and guile, and almost on the point of
ordering his men to make an assault, a brilliant idea came
jumping into the brain of Rolie Polie. “Oh, ho,” thought
he, “I know King Tommy would like to have me capture
this old Red Beard, and here, the very first thing, is my
chance. I will just open the gate and let them inside the
walls, then I will jump outside, close and lock the gate,
and there I shall have the whole company safe and sound
where they can’t get away.”</p>

<p>No sooner did this clever idea enter the brain of Rolie
Polie, than the little guard was unlocking the gate and
throwing it wide open. Then step, step, step, every man
going softly on tiptoe, through the gate went Red Beard
followed by his two hundred ragamuffin ruffians.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” laughed Rolie Polie, as he turned the key
in the lock, “that is the time I was too clever for Red
Beard!”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” laughed Red Beard, “did anyone ever see
a body so stupid as that Rolie Polie? Here I have King
Tommy and Queen Helen, and all the Lords and Ladies
at my mercy. It is a fine company of captives I will get
to put in chains and march as slaves to Grumbletown.”</p>

the gardens, it would not have been surprising
if the King had forgotten his guard
at the gate. This he did not do, however,
and at the moment when Red Beard and
his men were entering, a page was being
dispatched for Rolie Polie.</p>

<p>Thus, it happened then, that when the page was about
to enter the court yard, he saw it thronged with ruffians.</p>

<p>“We are betrayed!” he cried as he ran hurrying back to
the gardens. “The gates have been opened and the enemy
is now within the walls!” <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span></p>

<p>At this cry, the Ladies turned pale with fright and the
Nobles sought hastily for the swords they had laid aside
at the beginning of the dance. “Every man be brave!”
shouted the King. “We must rally to the defence of the
Ladies! Let King Red Beard and his ruffians come, they
will find us ready!”</p>

<p>But for all King Tommy spoke so bravely, he was not
at all deceived, and realized quite the same, as did the
Mayor and some others, that any defence would prove
practically useless, and at best do no more than prolong
an engagement, which in the end could result only in
their defeat and capture.</p>

<p>To reach the gardens from the court yard, it was necessary
to go half way around, or else right through the
Castle; the Grumbletown company, therefore, divided;
one party going one way, the other going another way.</p>

<p>As has been told, Red Beard and his followers, when
once within the walls of the Castle, were in high glee.
“We will make a fine big capture of prisoners to-day, my
hearties,” said the King. “When this fine boy and girl are
marching to Grumbletown dragging their heavy chains
along the highway, they will wish that that old toy maker,
Peter Poodle, had never brought them on a visit to Toyville.
What ho, my brave followers, do I speak the truth?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” answered the band, barely above a
whisper, not wishing to be heard by the Toy people.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Red Beard, “we will make a fine capture of
prisoners and a big haul of treasure. Every man must fill
his pockets with gold and silver and jewels, all he can
carry; we will loot the whole Castle. That will be a haul
worth making; what
ho, my hearties?” <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span></p>

<p>“Aye, aye, aye!” replied the band.</p>

<p>“We must make no noise,” said Red Beard. “Every man
creep along stealthily, take them by surprise. I say that’s
the way to make a good capture.”</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i137.jpg" width="600" height="554" alt="The Page."></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>While Red Beard was talking and creeping along so
slowly, King Tommy would have had time to make
new plans for defence, had any chance existed of such
plans proving successful. “There is nothing for us to do
but depend upon our swords,” said he
to Mr. Poodle. <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Poodle, “and our swords are far too
few to withstand an onslaught from so many big burly
ruffians. I was going to suggest that we make a dash for
the Castle and bar the doors. Our chances would then be
better. But judging from the sounds, I fear that the Castle
is already occupied.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, much excitement prevailed among all the
Ladies who by now were occupying one of the pavilions
on the far side of the lawn. Tommy attributed this excitement
to a fear which the circumstances rendered only
natural. But now the excitement seemed to be from some
other cause, and presently the King was surprised to see
Queen Helen, accompanied by the Royal Ladies, come
hurrying across the lawn.</p>

<p>“O, Tommy,” said the Queen, “an old lady, an old
servant, I think, has just told me she knows of a secret
passage underground, through which we can escape! come
quickly!”</p>

<p>The old dame, a little lady wearing a tall peaked cap,
had followed immediately after the Queen. “Yes, your
Majesty, I can show you the way; come with me,” she said.</p>

<p>That funny little twinkle went dancing about in Mr.
Poodle’s eyes again, when he saw the old dame. There
was a twinkle in her eyes, too; but though she tipped him
a courtsey and he bowed politely, neither spoke even one
word to the other.</p>

<p>On the lawn, midway between where the King and
his men had assembled, and the pavilion from which the
Queen had just come, there foamed a beautiful fountain,
made in the manner of a great marble basin. On the rim
of the basin there was the green head of
a great bronze <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
fish, apparently just rising from out the water. On the back
of the fish sat a chubby little boy, sculptured so faithfully
in marble as almost to seem alive.</p>

<p>The little old dame hurriedly led the King and Queen,
accompanied by all the company, straight towards the
great head of the fish. Putting forth her hand, she three
times wiggled the big toe of the chubby boy; at the third
wiggle the mouth of the fish opened, revealing a long flight
of stairs running down under the fountain. The next
minute, the little old dame stepped into this mouth and
onto the stairs, being quickly followed by all the others.
The King was the last to enter. As he did so, he turned
for one look at the Castle, and saw the infuriated Red
Beard and his followers entering the gardens. Then the
jaws of the fish closed and the passage became sealed.</p>

<p>The way was now pitch dark. Overhead could be heard
the tumbling waters of the fountain. A scarey sound that
seemed too, but not half so scarey as the terrible wild cry
of the baffled Red Beard, which could be heard even
through the thick walls of marble.</p>

<p>King Tommy could hear the step, step, step, of those
ahead of him and the muffled drone of their voices, as
they spoke words of encouragement to one another.
“Where are we?” he wondered. Then his feet no longer
kept going down when he stepped, but travelled on a level
pavement, and he knew that the end of the stairs had
been reached. Minute after minute passed, and still the
passage continued. Would its end never be reached?
Could it be possible the little old dame was a Grumbletown
spy and had deceived them? Did the way lead to
some trap? With these thoughts chasing
through his mind, <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
the King came almost to the point of wishing that the
company had remained in the garden.</p>

<p>The next moment, however, he realized that almost any
fate would be better than that which would have befallen
them at the hands of King Red Beard and his ruffians.
Then he remembered the look in the old dame’s eyes,
when she had bid them hurry, and he thought, “I won’t
believe any ill of her before it happens. She looked kind
and honest, and I am sure in the end everything will come
out all right.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Those were certainly the kind of thoughts a King should
have; and the moment Tommy let the bright sunshine
of hope enter his mind and travel along with him for
wayfellow, just that very moment he came to a turn in
the path, and not a hundred feet beyond saw the bright
sunshine of day streaming into a broad space at what
appeared to be the end of the passage.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i143b.jpg" width="406" height="443" alt="C"></span>RYSTAL lights lit the passage, and seemed
to be glowing and glimmering through a
great globe set in the black earth above
their heads. At first, no one could understand
the meaning of this, but presently the
doubt was dispelled by the little old dame
who led the way up a flight of stairs cut in the solid rock,
and out through an opening into a little park, scarcely a
stone’s throw from the Castle gates.</p>

<p>An expression of surprise now escaped from the lips of
everyone, for upon looking back, it was found that the
passage had led right in under a great crystal
bowl, full to <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
the brim of tumbling, tossing, sunkissed water. Yes, the
secret passage had begun at one fountain and ended at
another; but while the basin of the first was all marble,
that of the second was all of glass, and although the
entrance had been through the mouth of a great green
fish, the exit led through the mouth of a great green frog.</p>

<p>Everybody now hurried and hid behind the vases and
pots and shrubs scattered through the park, not knowing
how soon they might be discovered by Red Beard. In
this hurry the King held tightly to the hand of the Queen,
and close upon their heels followed Mr. Poodle. The sun,
slowly sinking, seemed now quite close to the hills of
Troubleland, and the afternoon was drawing towards
evening.</p>

<p>“I see no sign of the Grumbletown people,” said the
King. “Do you think they have departed, Mr. Poodle?
Look, Rolie Polie is standing guard at the gate. Perhaps
Red Beard is robbing the Castle. I wish we could get
word to the army.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, finding no immediate danger threatening
them, the Toy people, one after another gathered about
their King. Some were in favor of arresting Rolie Polie,
and putting him in irons for opening the gates and betraying
the Castle. Others counselled against this.</p>

<p>Although King Tommy could not understand why Rolie
Polie had opened the gates, nevertheless he felt sure the
little clown had not betrayed his trust, and that in the
end a reason would be found justifying the action. He
was, therefore, glad to hear the little old lady speak,
cautioning the Toy people not to act rashly. Then, turning
to the King, she said: “Not
knowing whether Red <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
Beard is within or outside the Castle walls, it seems
unwise to dispatch a messenger for the soldiers and risk
his being made captive. Why not go and speak a word
or two with yonder guard?”</p>

<p>King Tommy appreciated this advice; and drawing his
sword, he stepped forth boldly towards the little man at
the gate.</p>

<p>Rolie Polie, hearing footsteps, looked about and saw the
King.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he cried, his face full of pride, his eyes
dancing with happiness, “come quickly and help guard
the gate; I have the Grumbletown King and all of his
ruffians captive in the Castle. Am I not a fine soldier?”</p>

<p>These words were spoken so suddenly that for a
moment the King failed to grasp their meaning. Then, all
at once, it came to him why Rolie Polie had opened the
gates, and he saw that the little guard had indeed laid a
clever trap, in which, without doubt, were now captive
King Red Beard and all of his Grumbletown followers.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he cried, turning and waving his sword to
Mr. Poodle and the others. “Rolie Polie has captured the
Grumbletown ruffians, come quickly and help hold the
gate.”</p>

<p>A glad shout greeted this cry from the King, as with
one accord the little company, each man drawing his
sword, made a rush to reinforce the clever and brave guard,
Rolie Polie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, much had happened within the walls of
the Castle, for Red Beard and his followers had entered
the gardens at the exact moment when King Tommy was
stepping into the mouth
of the fish. <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span></p>

<p>“Look, my men! look!” cried Red Beard, his face white
with fright, his hair standing on end. “The Green Fish of
the Fountain has swallowed all the Toy people. It is some
mighty magician! Oh, why did we ever come into this
city! why did we ever leave peaceful Grumbletown!”
Then, unable longer to make his trembling legs support
him, Red Beard fell fainting with fright.</p>

<p>The faces of his followers were as white as their King’s,
save only a few, who were too far behind to see what
had happened.</p>

<p>These few, when they reached the garden and found
their fellows almost fainting and Red Beard lying like one
dead, upon the ground, knew not what to do, until presently
one of them, seeing the King yet breathing, cried:
“We must get water; somebody bring water to the King!”</p>

<p>This request was more easily asked than answered, as
nowhere near at hand could be found anything in which
to carry the water. But the ruffians were not long without
a way for solving that difficulty, and quick as a wink
they had Red Beard in their arms, and the next minute
were tumbling him heels over head into the fountain.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for that ducking to make the Grumbletown
King open his eyes. “Where am I? Where am
I?” he cried, floundering about in the basin and blowing
the water out of his nose and mouth. Then, he looked up
and saw the green fish. “Help! help! help!” he called.
“The Fish has me! Save me from the Fish!” and with one
big effort he reached the rim of the basin, clambered over,
and without once turning to look back, he ran with all
possible speed through the garden towards the Castle
gate, followed by
his whole band. <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span></p>

<p>But now the gate was locked, and outside could be
heard the cheering Toy people.</p>

<p>“Open the gate, little Guard! Open the gate!” cried the
shivering, shaking Red Beard. “Open the gate little Guard!
Open it quickly! The Green Fish is after us! Open the
gate, and we will lay down our swords and pistols and
go back to Grumbletown! Open the gate, little Guard, and
never again will we come to Toyville! Save us from the
Green Fish!”</p>

<p>The jolly, laughing eyes of the little old lady twinkled
at Mr. Poodle. “King Tommy may open the gates without
any fear now,” she said. “Red Beard and his fellows
are so frightened at the Green Fish that they will never
again venture near Toyville.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle quickly repeated this message to the King,
and as a result, it was not long before the Grumbletown
ruffians, led by their King, had laid their swords and
guns on the lawn, and were marching out of the gates; a
crestfallen and woebegone looking fellowship they were,
too, and no mistake.</p>

<p>Rolie Polie and one of the Royal Guards accompanied
them to the hills. Every little while Red Beard looked
back over his shoulder, fearing constantly that he was
being followed by the Green Fish. At the foot of the
hills they came upon men who were awaiting them with
horses and donkeys. Among the animals, Rolie Polie found
Coal Black and Snow White, who neighed with pleasure
at seeing their old comrade. Rolie Polie now bade good
day to Red Beard, who was yet too frightened to answer,
and leading Coal Black while his companion led Snow
White, took the road
back to Toyville. <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span></p>

<p>“That is a fine soldier, your Majesty,” said the little dame
to the King, as Rolie Polie came prancing into the court
yard upon his return from the hills. “Such a fine and clever
little soldier could well fill a higher station than that of
Royal Guard. Not that I want to say a Royal Guard is not a
fine position, for it is quite true, few are finer. But there
are not many guards could capture, single handed, such a
bold ruffian as Red Beard, to say nothing of his two hundred
followers.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” replied the King; “and I have a reward
for him which I think will prove a big suprise.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>And a suprise it certainly was, as we shall soon see.</p>

to Rolie Polie came just in the nick
of time. Tommy enjoyed very much being
a King, and Helen found no less pleasure in
being a Queen; but the day had been so full
of excitement that both were feeling tired.</p>

<p>It was now drawing towards the close of the afternoon
and Helen began to realize that, although it was delightful
to be a Queen daytimes, the going down of the sun at the
approach of evening made nothing quite so nice as her
home and her mamma. This, I am told, is a truth that has
also come to many another little girl.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” she then said to King Tommy, “do you
think it is almost time to start on
our return journey?” <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” answered Tommy. “And, Helen, now that
I am a King myself, I need not hunt for the Fairy King to
get riches for the kind lady in the hills. I am sure the Toy
people will allow me to take some of their treasure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure they will,” said Helen, “because they
will want to make the kind lady happy.”</p>

<p>“I will go at once and find Mr. Poodle,” said Tommy.
Then a look of trouble came into his happy face and he
added; “What do you think the Toy people will do without
a King and Queen when they are threatened by the
ruffians of Grumbletown? Perhaps there will be an attack
to-night. Do you think I should remain here and be their
protector, Helen? Of course you must go home, for if you
are late, your mamma will worry.”</p>

<p>Mr. Poodle stood not far away and overheard this talk.</p>

<p>“You need not fear an attack from Grumbletown, at
night,” said he, laughing. “Why, King Red Beard and his
subjects are such ‘fraid cats’ of the dark, that they never
stir out of their houses after sunset. Then, too, they had
such a fright to-day, I do not believe they will ever again
come to Toyville.”</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the return of Rolie Polie
called forth the words of praise from the little old dame.</p>

<p>A bright idea then came to the King, and he hurried off
to see his Prime Minister. “Assemble the Lords and Nobles
in the Throne Room,” he said to that gentleman, as soon
as he had found him.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister hurried to obey the King’s command.</p>

<p>A few moments later, when his Majesty stepped upon
his Golden Throne, he found such a gathering of the
noblest in the land, as any King might be
proud to see. <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span></p>

<p>“My beloved subjects,” he said, “your Queen and your
King have ruled over this happy and joyous realm of
Toyville as wisely and as loyally as has been within
their power. It is now time for us to depart for our home
over the hills. We both wish that some person worthy
of your trust could occupy the throne in our absence;
some one to bear the title, First Assistant King, and we
would suggest for this high and responsible position, the
brave and clever guard, Mr. Rolie Polie.” Then the King
seated himself beside his Queen on the Golden Throne.</p>

<p>In a moment the Mayor was on his feet. “Three cheers
for Rolie Polie! Three cheers for the First Assistant King!”
he cried, and the answer came long and loud.</p>

<p>Rolie Polie was taken completely by surprise, and knew
not what to say. Mr. Poodle also was taken by surprise,
but being a man of experience, he was not embarrassed,
and told the people he thought their choice was wise.</p>

<p>“Order out the Royal Guard of Honor,” was the message
the Mayor now sent to the General of the army. So, not
until the little company reached the big gate at the top of
the curly road did the time arrive to say good-bye, for in
addition to being accompanied by the Royal Guard, their
escort included every notable in Toyville.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, your Majesties, good-bye Mr. Poodle,” said
Rolie, shaking their hands warmly. Then he added: “I will
be a good King and do my best.”</p>

<p>“We know you will,” answered Tommy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Poodle, “do your best, Rolie Polie, then
you will win, for that is the way to get on in the world.”</p>

<p>These were the last words spoken as the little company
passed through the gates and the
big cannon boomed <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
out a parting salute. The sun was now low in the sky,
casting a golden glow along the path, and making blue
shadows gather in the valley.</p>

<p>They had not ridden long, when Mr. Poodle said: “Here
we are at home;” and sure enough, as he spoke, Coal Black
and Snow White went galloping into Mr. Poodle’s back
garden and over the threshold into the toy shop.</p>

<p>“Do you think Rolie Polie will get along all right, Mr.
Poodle?” asked Tommy, as they were bidding good night
to the toy maker.</p>

<p>“O, yes,” said Mr. Poodle. “Nobody need worry about
a King who has Mother Goose near his throne to help him
in his ruling.”</p>

<p>“Mother Goose?” repeated Tommy, wonderingly. “Is
Mother Goose in Toyville?” “O, yes,” answered Mr. Poodle,
“she was the little old dame who led us out of the garden
and saved our being captured by Red Beard. And, by the
way, Mother Goose said that she hoped on our next journey,
we would continue through the Valley of Happiness,
until we came to her realm, where she promised there
would be awaiting us the finest kind of a good time.”</p>

<p>“O, Tommy, isn’t Mr. Poodle kind to us!” said Helen,
her eyes moist with little pearls of happiness. Tommy’s
lips trembled when he tried to reply. Mr. Poodle was
such a clever man, though, that I guess he knew what kind
of a lump had swelled up in Tommy’s throat, for he
didn’t say one single word, but held out both his arms,
and in a second there were his playmates hugging him so
tightly that it was almost as much as he could do to
breathe.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i157b.jpg" width="374" height="442" alt="T"></span>HE sun had been up some hours when
Tommy awoke in his little bed at the toymaker’s
the next day. Then, oh my, what
a surprise he did have! for the moment he
opened his eyes, they looked right into the
loveliest, sweetest eyes in all the world; and
he knew that those eyes belonged to—his dear mother.</p>

<p>Yes, Tommy’s own dear mother was leaning over his
little bed in Peter Poodle’s toy shop. She hugged him
ever and ever so tight, and there were happy tears in her
eyes. And, on the other side of the bed, was—his father!</p>

<p>All in a pop, Tommy’s memory had come back to him;
the memory that went away when he was so sick at the
wood-chopper’s house in the hills.</p>

<p>Tommy didn’t know how his father and mother happened
to be in Peter Poodle’s toy shop, and he was too
happy to try and think. Then he
remembered that his <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
name wasn’t Tommy. “Oh, Mr. Poodle,” he said, as he
saw the little toy maker come into the room, “I am not a
King any more, because my father is the King. But I am
a Prince, Mr. Poodle, and my name is Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, you are a Prince,” said Mr. Poodle, “and
sometime you will be King.”</p>

<p>A troubled look now came into Prince Arthur’s eyes.
“Will the Toy people love me when I am a real King,
Mr. Poodle?” he asked; “and will they have me for their
King, too? Because I like to be the King of Toyville, and
I want to drive away the King of Grumbletown.”</p>

<p>“Toy people will always love you,” said Mr. Poodle,
“because you are always very kind to them; and when
you are a real King, you can ask all the children to be
kind to their toys, and then, pretty soon, there won’t be
any more Grumbletown, because no toys will go there.”</p>

<p>“That is what I will do the very first day I am King,”
said the Prince. “And now I will get up and send the
Toyville treasure to the kind lady in the hills.”</p>

<p>“No need to do that, dear,” said his mother. “The wood
chopper and his good wife are right here, and no longer
poor, for the King has rewarded their care of his boy.”</p>

<p>The Prince looked across the room, and there, sure
enough, was the kind lady, and the wood chopper who
now wore a uniform of the King’s Royal House Guard.</p>

<p>Although the Prince felt tired, from his long journey
to Toyville, he quickly jumped out of bed, and the next
minute was giving the kind lady a big hug. Then he
dressed, and by that time Helen came to play with him.</p>

<p>“I am not a King any more,” he said to Helen, “because,
you see, I am only a King’s son. But I am
a Prince, and <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
my name is Arthur. You may call me Tommy, though, if
you wish. Some time I am going to be a King, and then
will you be my Queen, Helen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” said Helen, “and I am going to call you
Arthur, because that is your really truly name. I wish
you would come and play now. I have brought you
Captain Pinkle and Captain Poddle, but I couldn’t bring
Rolie Polie, because he is not here any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered the Prince, “it wouldn’t be right for
Rolie Polie to come, because he must stay and be King in
Toyville. Thank you, Helen, for bringing Captain Pinkle
and Captain Poddle. Why, this is the same box I carried
to the Black Lion! Did the bad men send it to Mr. Poodle?”</p>

<p>“The bad men were captured by the King’s soldiers
and are now in prison,” answered the Queen. “Thanks to
the wood chopper’s good wife, who followed you in your
long tramp through the hills, we have our boy again, and
those who stole him away are punished.”</p>

<p>The Prince did not play very hard that afternoon, and
by and by he said to Helen: “I do not know why going
to Toyville has made me so tired, but I suppose being a
King is hard work. Do you think it is, Helen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Helen. “I think being a King is very
hard, and takes a big man like your papa. But some time
you will be a big man, and then being a King won’t make
you tired any more.”</p>

<p>This happy time of their playing passed all too hurriedly
for Helen, who hardly realized its ending before she
found herself saying goodbye to her little playmate.</p>

<p>“You will come and see me soon, won’t you Helen?”
said the Prince, his lips trembling.
“Come very soon <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
Helen, because I want a little girl to play with and to go
with me on journeys; and O, Helen, now I have a
mamma of my own, and perhaps she will read us stories.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I will read stories to you,” said the Queen,
turning from talking earnestly with Helen’s mamma,
who had come to say goodbye to the Prince, “and Helen
is coming to see us very, very soon.”</p>

<p>Then the goodbys were all said, and amidst the cheering
of the townspeople who were lining the streets
outside the toyshop, the King and Queen, accompanied
by the Royal House Guards, bore the Prince away to his
new home in the Castle among the hills.</p>

<p>That evening when Helen had been tucked snugly in
her little bed, she said: “Mamma, how did Prince Arthur
get lost; did somebody steal him away from his home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Helen’s mamma. Then she snuggled
down on the bed and hugging Helen close, told her how,
a while ago, the young Prince had been stolen away by
the ruffians and left in the forest where he was found by
the good wood chopper.</p>

<p>“Was the Prince ill when he was found?” asked Helen.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” answered her mamma, “the Prince was so
ill that, when the fever left him, it took away his memory,
and he did not know that he was a King’s son.”</p>

<p>“Did the wood chopper know that the little boy he
found was a Prince, mamma?”</p>

<p>“No,” said her mamma; “the wicked men had dressed
the Prince in ragged clothes when they left him in the
forest to starve, and he did not look at all like a Prince.”</p>

<p>“How did the King ever find the Prince?” asked Helen.
“Did he go to the wood
chopper’s house, mamma?” <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span></p>

<p>“No, dear, he was hunting everywhere for some trace
of his lost boy, and the wood chopper’s wife was hunting
too, and she had followed the Prince almost to this city.
Then one day the King met her, and he knew from what
she told him that his Arthur was alive; so he came riding
with his soldiers as fast as ever he could and saw the
little Prince just as he entered the Black Lion Inn.
Now dear, it is time for my little girl to go to sleep!”</p>

<p>But Helen wasn’t one bit sleepy. “Why was the Prince
stolen away, mamma?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” answered her mamma. “Some people
say that the King’s brother, Duke Robert, who is called
Robert the Red, had him stolen so his own son would
be heir to the throne, but no one knows this for certain.
If Robert the Red did have him taken away, he never
can steal him again, because the King has made the wood
chopper the Prince’s own special guard, and he and his
good wife will now live in the Castle.”</p>

<p>“Robert the Red was a wicked man to steal away the
Prince, wasn’t he, mamma!” said Helen. “Will the Prince
be a King some day, mamma, and will he come for me and
make me a Queen, like he said?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Helen’s mamma, “there is Grandpapa
calling me. Good night, little Wideawake.” Then she gave
Helen a hug, and turning the light low, left the room.</p>

<p>“Mamma didn’t answer my question,” thought Helen.
“But never mind, I know he will, because Tommy said he
would,—Prince Arthur, I mean.” Then she closed her eyes
and soon was fast asleep.</p>

there now hangs a big and comical sign on
which is painted a chubby little soldier with
a red coat and a black hat. Right over the
soldier, in black letters with curly red capitals,
appears the name

<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i163.ia.king.png" width="168" height="60" alt="King">.</span>
This is how it happened:</p>

<p>One day a big wagon drove up in front of Peter Poodle’s
shop; in it there was a large, flat, wooden box, sealed with
the Royal Coat of Arms. “Does Mr. Poodle live here?”
asked the driver. “Yes,” answered the toy maker.</p>

<p>The next minute, much to the surprise of the little man,
he saw the big box being deposited right in the middle of
the floor of his shop. Mr. Poodle unscrewed the lid with
trembling fingers. Inside, packed carefully, so it would not
receive a single scratch, was the beautiful sign. With the
sign also came a great parchment, signed and sealed with
the Royal Arms. On this parchment were letters telling
how Mr. Poodle had been made Toy Maker to the King.</p>

<p>While Mr. Poodle was folding up the papers and wrappings
that had come about the sign, so as to put them all
away neatly, a little envelope dropped to the floor. This
likewise bore the Royal Seal, and when Mr. Poodle had
it open, he found a very kind note from the Queen ordering
ever and ever so many toys for the Prince. It also contained
an invitation for Mr. Poodle to come and visit at the
Castle, together with a kind message
from the Prince. <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span></p>

<p>And now my story is at an end. I hope you will agree
with me that Peter Poodle received what really was no
more than he deserved, which, indeed, is but the very
truth; for a finer little man it would be hard to find, as
you surely would say could you know him as well as I do.</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i164.jpg" width="600" height="34" alt=""></div><!--dctr01-->

<p>What became of Rolie Polie? Did the little clown make
a good King? Did Helen go to visit the Prince? And did
they ever return to Toyville?</p>

<p>Lucky those questions were asked so quickly, for the ink
upon my pen was almost dry and I had drawn my chair
to the fire for a little snooze before dinner.</p>

<p>Yes, Helen visited the Prince, and with Mr. Poodle the
two made many more trips to Toyville, and to the Realm
of Mother Goose. Of course, after the Prince had been
away for so long a time the King and Queen wanted to
have him in the Castle near them always, but bye and
bye, when Mr. Poodle came with the toys the Queen had
ordered, and brought Helen with him, the Queen very
kindly gave her consent to another trip to Toyville.</p>

<p>Much to their surprise, upon again entering the Valley
of Happiness, they found the Realm to be ruled not by
Rolie Polie, but by King Hans the First, called by some
King Hans the Happy, and by others Happy Hans. However,
their surprise and wonder were soon dispelled by the
Mayor, who told Mr. Poodle how, at the first meeting of
the councillors following the departure of King Tommy
and Queen Helen, it had been suggested that the name
Rolie Polie, while being a fine one for a clown, really
seemed too frivolous for a King, so by an act of Parliament
it was changed to Hans the First. <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span></p>

<p>Mr. Poodle highly commended this action, and then
asked if the rule of Hans the First had been a happy one.</p>

<p>The Mayor laughed merrily at that question. “Indeed it
has,” said he; “but you may see for yourself, as the Court
Historian has recorded it all in a big book.”</p>

<div class="dctr01">
<img src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i165.jpg" width="600" height="546" alt=""></div><!--dctr01-->

<div>
<img id="glyphparagraph" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i165.ia.png" width="800" height="188" alt="
  Sure enough, when they reached the Castle there was the big book
  and on the cover were letters spelling words which read: A Most
  Marvellous History, Wherein is Recorded the Strange and Wonderous
  Happenings of Happy Hans."></div><!---->

<p id="p166">Mr. Poodle
has often, since then, read all of that history
to Helen and Tommy, and with them has had many a
good laugh over its merry tales. I, too, have enjoyed a
laugh over those quaint pages, for Mr. Poodle brought the
book back with him from Toyville, and now keeps it in
his shop, where anybody may read the words as easily
as can be, for they are not at all big or hard to spell.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Sometime, I think I will ask Mr. Poodle to allow me to
send that
<img class="iglyph-a" src="./books/Peter Poodle, by William Henry Bradley, A Project Gutenberg eBook_files/i166.ia.history.png" width="281" height="60" alt="History">
to the Printer Man and have more
copies made, so that other little boys and girls can read all
about Hans and his strange and wonderful adventures,
of which there is no room to tell anything here, as anyone
can see quite plainly, for there is only space enough left
to print this one little picture.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
